ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563253e6),"I went here for lunch with a few co-workers.  I actually liked the food.  Growing up in San Antonio, I prefer this kind of mexican food: no color only shades of brown, heavy on the cheese, heavy on the salsa.  Wow, now that I write that, I doesnt sound so great... but really, that's what I like.  And that's more or less what I got at Tee Pee's.  So food-wise, it's probably a THREE STAR.But there were some real drawbacks.The chips were slightly stale.  It should be a small thing, but you'd think a ""landmark"" restaurant could handle keeping fresh chips.The decor is dated and cramped.  The old vinyl seats are ugly, but more importantly, they are uncomfortable and very small.  Two adults sitting side-by-side had better be very friendly.Finally, the service is horrible.  And to me, that is easily the biggest problem.  The waitress constantly left our drinks empty and had to be reminded every time we asked for anything.In reality, Tee Pee's should be right up my alley.  But their ""we're too busy to worry about the small things"" is a big problem.  I'm not sure they will ever get a second chance with me."

Two lattes and a hot green tea later, I am realizing the gravity of his premonition.Cartel Coffee Lab has to be one of the coolest spots in Tempe. It is appropriately named as a place that would foster an addiction, and addicted I now am. It has the definite feel of an old warehouse. It is dimly lit, has high, exposed rafters and cooling vents, a concrete floor, and a usable garage door at the back. The layout is great, with a bar, several couches, and a good number of tables fully wired with plugs for the mac or pc-wielding crowd. It's a funky place, very urban; the main room is separated by an art installation made of bike tire rims. Cartel seems to attract a hugely eclectic group of patrons, from unbathed hipsters to ASU students to very cool coffee snobs. I sat next to the most interesting man, definitely a regular, and learned that he owns the old flour mill on Mill Ave! He also shared the most delicious almond cookie with me, baked by his father. Very cool. Yes, the coffee. The coffee and espresso are fantastic. People complain that the service is slow, but calmatevi amici, they are making the valley's best coffee, to order, and that takes time! Their beans are direct trade, roasted in house. Try the espresso - it's perfect. Regular coffee fan? They use the Clover, a single serve machine that makes every cup special, just for you. They will alternatively use this awesome manual system with paper filters to drip your coffee nice and slow. I like that they make you commit - large or small - and they keep their menu very simple, so you'll need to get your vanilla lattes elsewhere.  Their default milk is whole (so good), from a local organic farm - and so remember to ask for skim if you are watching that waistline. The baristas are super cool and friendly, and gave me a great welcome. Cartel is my new favorite caffeine haven. Thank you friend of a friend for the recommendation - I am a convert, and have definitely found my Tempe fix for a great, independent coffee house. I may have a hard time going anywhere else! (Don't worry Lux, you're still my first love, I promise.)"
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b563236ac),"Sorry, but something must have happened to this place since Ellen J. and Monica B. wrote their reviews.  My girlfriend and I went there tonight for our monthly sushi fix and to catch up.  It was nice to have it so quiet - we were the only ones in the restaurant for an hour - but we understand why.  The service was attentive but the food was poor.  The portions are small - you get twice as much at most other places for the same price - the happy hour offered nothing of interest - and they do not have a full bar as is listed - only beer and wine.  Imitation crabmeat?  Sorry - that's just not authentic fare and definitely not serious sushi.   We were very disappointed.  Fortunately the conversation was good!  But we won't be back here again."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323643),"The service at Blue Fin earns all the stars, as far as I'm concerned. There are other equally tasty (and in some cases more flavorful) places to grab a rice bowl. The service is outstandingly hospitible though; so, you can't help but leave Blue Fin with a warm fuzzy feeling toward your hosts!"

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563247ee),"The beer list here is GREAT. Seriously. If you like craft brews, go here.The food is meh. There are a lot of really interesting combinations, but the execution wasnt the best. The service is also meh. All 8 of us had to be wary when our waitress came around to tell her that so and so needed something too. She would take one or two orders at a time. Seriously though, the beer is awesome."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632514d),"****3.5 STARS****I came here Friday night for some dinner and to meet up with an old friend from long ago who was in from out of town.  I had never been here before, and thought it was worth a shot.  I wanted some place nice, but not to pretencious, so we came to crust.The place is really nicely decorated, classy, simple yet elegant, and pleasing to the eye.  If I lived closer, I could see coming here for a glass of wine and a small appitizer during happy hour or early on a Saturday evening.  The place is on the small side, but they have a decent seating arrangement making the most of thier space.  The place seems to fill up quickly, so if you left waiting, your stuck hanging out on the sidewalk.  I really liked their wine and alcohol menu, and the staff seems to be educated and knowledgeable from what I could tell.  Menu had a great selection of food, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.I ended up getting a glass of Reisling wine with a dish of Macaroni and Cheese.  I know, Mac and Cheese you say?  I wanted to keep it simple, and was really eyeing the filet mignon sliders, but decided at the last minute to go with the mac and cheese.  I will say the Mac and Cheese was good, but I wasn't blown away. I don't regret getting it, but I wasn't taken aback by it.  The presentation of it was nice, but I think it came out to crispy on the top. Service was quick, friendly and professional.  Great for dates, fussy parents (like mine) or a nice night out with a girlfriend.  Menu selection was broad in dishes and prices, and decor was pleasant and relaxing.  I would reccomend stopping in and checking this place out."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324b0b),"Queso dip was good and I loved the thin crispy tortilla chips, but everything else was below average as far as food goes.  Service was alright, atmosphere and fun and lively, but it also wasn't terribly clean.The parking is a royal pain to figure out for the first time, or if it's been awhile since your last visit."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324eda),"Decent bar food with all the servers dressed in Alice Cooper attire.  I am being open-minded and starting this thing off with 5 stars.  Minus one star for being a bit overpriced on the appetizer end.  I ordered onion rings at $8 per order.  Seriously, are 15 onion rings worth $8? Minus one star for not having any parking.  You have to park a couple of blocks away in the ghetto area to find a spot.  You will have 2-3 beggars asking you for change to and from your car.  There was a dude who wanted to wash my windows for money.  Minus half a star for putting the gratuity on the bill and charging for it.  I hate that crap.  Plus half a star for the waitresses who are dressed heavy metal-like wearing mid-riffs with the tramp stamp.  I always wanted to date chicks like that, but was ummm...to busy with umm....other chicks chasing me down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I just umm...you know, didnt have time for them at that point in my life.  I better stop my review now."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325407),"It really depends on what you order here. This place is open late so we decided to try it out. They have a $5 menu all day as well, which could be a make it or break it deal to come back. Nice, relaxing place to chill and the service is good.1) $5 Papaya salad with crab. HECK TO THE NO!!! It was overly salty, fishy smelling/tasting, with old dead crab shells. I thought it'd be at least some imitation crab, but no. It was nasty crab legs soaked in with the vinegar. The papaya was way too sour and salty to enjoy.2) $5 Chicken and noodles. It sounded just meh, but it was actually really good with lots of chicken (surprisingly) and other veggies like mushrooms, bamboo, onions etc. They gave really little angel hair pasta but the flavor of spices was really good. Decent in terms of legit pasta (rather get it from a Chinese restaurant).3) **GREEN CURRY. The curry was really good here. It was the right balance of sweet and salty. They gave lots of veggies and meat in their curry as well. We ordered beef, which unfortunately was a little chewy.All in all, a decent meal...great when you are starving and craving something with flavor.Thai only spiced me up to 3 stars."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324ee2),"Never, never, never going here again...Hearing complaining about tips is a HUGE turn off in my book. Upon entering Autumn Court the server/bartender was complaining to a man sitting at the bar that the last customers that she served did not leave her a tip. (To be honest, I would have considered stiffing her too after these comments.) She then had the audacity to ask the customer if she should go out and ask them for one! This is all while we were waiting to be seated. The customer said ""I wouldn't"" and she made a dash for the side door heading to the parking lot. The customer turned to us and said he had never seen anything like that before. Wait...there's more. We turned around and left to find a different place to eat and I made a call to the manager to let him know what had happened. He listened, but offered no resolution and took my information to pass to the owner. Five minutes later my cell phone starts ringing and it is the server (seriously!?) we called about asking why we thought it was not right that she did that and told me that she had the RIGHT to tips because she was not paid hourly. I briefly spoke to her about the rudeness of speaking to customers about other customers and all she could say was that she would not get fired over this. Babe, if were my restaurant you would have totally have been gone for this. Tomorrow I'll try and contact the owner direct because we are never going there again and my phone number should not have been passed out like that. Time to find another neighborhood Chinese restaurant."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324dc7),"There is no dearth of quality pizza in Phoenix.  You would have thought we bordered the Bronx or Naples instead of old Mexico.  Between Bianco, LGO, Pino's, Slice of Sicily, Nello's, and Cassanova Brothers we have enough tasty and distinctive pies for every day of the week.I was a little hesitant to try Grimaldi's at first.  The location, after all, is essentially an outdoor mall laden with chains and conformity.  But hunger and a desire to try a place that claimed to offer the best coal fired pizza this side of NY got me in the door.  The pizza is lighter and smoky, unburdened by excess ingredients and heavy grease.  The best pizzas succeed in their simplicity and Grimaldi's is no exception.  You can taste the quality in the mozzarella and the sauce is a quiet and sweet companion that really ties everything together.The place has now earned a spot in my East Valley pizza rotation.  A great pizza that has flavor and won't give you a coronary."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325b46),"Unusual for a Vietnamese restaurant, I hold this place to the same standard of cleanliness I expect from a Chinese restaurant: if it tastes good and doesn't make me sick, it's a-okay! I have grown up in Asian restaurants and really, despite all the negative reviews, this place isn't that scary! If you're looking for ambiance, well, maybe you should save this one for another day. I can't say I've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant where the decorations blew me away. However, if you are craving some mighty decent Vietnamese cuisine, you have arrived at your destination.I grew up on Oahu where Pho places are like McDonalds- they are practically on every corner. It being one of my favorite foods, I've been to a great many restaurants for pho, and have tried to find a place that can fill that big beef noodle soup void in my heart..( or stomach.. same thing) since moving to Arizona. I've come to the conclusion that there is nothing in Tucson. Chandler, however, is fortunate enough to have this little gem.The bowls are large and very affordable.  The easiest difference to distinguish between pho places is the broth. Saigon has a pretty good broth, and offers almost all the right condiments. The only thing this place is missing is sate, which is like chili oil with garlic or shallots, and culantro. If only I could figure out what it's called in Vietnamese... Large in size with sharp edges, it is similar to cilantro but more subtle and slightly sweet. These, while a major drawback for me, are minor for the overall quality found here at Saigon. The beauty of pho is that it arrives light and fairly simple. Its up to you to customize your own bowl to your individual taste. The spring rolls are good, served properly dressed with lettuce leaves and mint for wrapping with traditional sweet sour fish sauce for dipping. If you like coffee, you haven't lived until you have had a Vietnamese iced coffee. No. Seriously.And a small but hugely fantastic thing? They have fresh coconuts that you can order to drink the juice out of! And eat the coconut flesh after of course.. MmmmSo while this isn't the best pho I've ever had in my life, it IS the best I've had in Arizona so far."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325257),so awesome great salmon/bagel breakfast dark coffee! and the chicken cashew salad is rockin!
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323511),"The problem with restaurants like this is when you have tried authentic Vietnamese food and there is a huge disparity in taste and quality. Sorry, but after trying their food twice, we will never come back again. It's a short drive to Pholicious or Old Glendale's Little Saigon, so we will just keep going to those two."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324a75),"Del frisco's is awesome. The food is delicious. I loved the tomato mozzarella flat bread, the mushroom flat bread, and the Mac and cheese. There was great service. I sat at the bar and the bartender was especially friendly and courteous. The restaurant has a really cool ambience and there is an amazing upstairs bar with a great view."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b5632456f),"My girlfriend and I had a mean craving for pizza and wings after browsing the Phoenix Zoo...We thought this place was Streets of New York, till we got there and it was a NYPD (did I mention I don't like police). lol So we said screw it and decided to check it out anyway. When we got there the host seemed annoyed and practically threw our menus on the table. He Sucked! We ordered the Hell's Kitchen wings and the Philly Cheese steak pizza. First off the Wings were fantastic, although not as spicy as we anticipated. The wings came with sliced jalape?Ðos scattered over the top of them, but it was just a psychological thing to make you think they're spicier. The Philly pizza was sub par. It was low on cheese and some what under cooked. There was still water from the meat running of the sides, basically making the crust soggy. Our waiter was very generous, unfortunately I forgot her name. She changed my perspective of the service.  For some strange reason, the host was still giving me the stink eye...I think he liked my girlfriend or something or may be just hated his job. lol    Overall, I would have preferred hitting up Streets of New York! By the way did I mention I don't like police. Except a friend of mine who just graduated the academy. Congratulations! Now keep me safe from other police."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323ecf),This place is great for a big group of people. We originally thought we were going to have 6 people. We ended up having 11 by the time everyone showed up. The staff was more than happy to accommodate us. The Kota Athenian chicken is very good. The price range is moderate. All in all a fantastic place.
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323592),"I don't care how much it costs. I'll never see another movie in anything other than their cinema suites again. Ever.I love their leather recliners! They are just as comfortable as the one at your grandparents house. Plus, you get beer delivered to you at the touch of a button and prices are surprisingly reasonable (4 for a pint of domestic, 5 for imports). Plus, you get a sample of specialty popcorn, a warm towel, and a Ghirardelli chocolate on your way out. It can get crowded in the evenings, so you might want to consider purchasing your tickets ahead of time.Don't go expecting AMC to serve you a gourmet meal unless you think Applebee's is a real treat."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324e19),"Gelato Spot has pretty good gelato. I'd still go to TCBY for their White Chocolate Mousse Yogurt over Gelato Spot any day though. But I can't say G-Spot has bad gelato. The amaretto, snicker, vanilla were all tasty. I question people who proclaim that this is the best Gelato they have ever tasted. Well, there isn't much competition in Phoenix. There's a couple great ones I've been to in Miami, LA, NYC and San Francisco. For what it is, G-Spot has good gelato. But, there are times, I prefer getting a Dreyers Light from the grocery store and find myself more satisfied."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324e7b),"Dante hated mediocrity and this place although not as firey as the name implies offers terrific recipies and a wonderful happy hour value in North Scottsdale. The staff is courteous and very friendly. 1/2 price happy hour items are delicious and plentiful. The cheap margaritas are full flavor and full of tequila. The happy hour in the cantina is kid friendly if you are looking for a reasonable place to fill the kids with chips and mini burritos. We had the sampler plate, shrimp cocktails and a basket of fresh corn and flour chips. With drinks for 3 we got out of there for around $30. Great value."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b5632447a),"They now offer more things for me to try since my last visit . The hot salsa tasted like can , I could taste can , it was canned smooth tomato product that was slightly spiked with something spicy . I tried the pico and I am not sure if the chopped tomatoes were frozen because they looked like frozen and thawed . The tomatoes were also unripe and the seasoning was unpleasant to me . I will not fault them for the margarita since I didn't expect the best but the margarita tasted like dry mix .As I mentioned in my last Yelp I didn't care for the seasoning of the chicken I had last time but I thought it was just me . I was afraid to order chicken again so I ordered a chili relleno . I took one bite and I didn't spit it out but I couldn't take a second bite either .  I only tasted pan oil . My husband tried it and he said it was awful and he felt bad  and said to try his food . I tried a piece of beef from his platter and it was just dry and tasted like it was just plain dry beef just soaked in jalape?Ðo brine . Maybe they are better at times and I was just unlucky with my visits .I think it was one of the owners that asked me how everything was . I didn't have the balls to tell her . Would you?"
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323ce8),"Ok food, good service. Wasn't bad just didn't stand out, I prefer lots of flavor on my Mexican food, and I thought most of what I ordered was more towards the bland side. The wife loved it though."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324323),"Been several times, always to the bar area or the patio. Highly suggest the patio for a girls nite out: classy & casual at the same time, fun, upbeat, great place to chat it up.  Great selection of wine by the glass, unique little (i do mean tiny) appies to nosh on."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323c80),"Took the mom and sister here for a cool down today and WOW! I had the Vesuvio, which had the ability to literally fill my mouth with flavor bursting from each little paddle full of goodness. Thankfully I chose the single scoop, because honestly it was so rich that I probably  would have gone in to an embarrassing moaning fest if there had been any more in my cup. Mom had the Light Mint Chip - a refreshing choice on such a hot summer day. Sister brazenly went for two scoops of Caffe Espresso paired with Chocolate.  Other than the much discussed PITA parking situation complements of LGO, there was not a single deterrent from the perfection of this experience."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323a99),"Let me tell you how much I love Texas Roadhouse.. or maybe I shouldn't because I could go on forever. As far as chain restaurants go, this has to be my favorite. So let's discuss why; first and foremost, THE BREAD IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER HAD. No exaggeration. I could eat that stuff all day. I don't care for the cinnamon butter stuff too much but my boyfriend really enjoys it. I used to only get their caesar salad, (which by the way is amazing too) but then I finally started to branch out and try other things. I have not been let down yet.Another awesome thing about this place is that the employees are all super nice and friendly and you can tell that they don't completely loathe their jobs... which is nice. So, Texas Roadhouse, I will continue to dine here with you for many years to come."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324bcb),"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. Loved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. Inside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of ""Dusk Till Dawn"". We were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. My Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.I'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323d86),"I have become a soda snob, and it's Pop the Soda Shops fault.  Sure I could drink regular Dr. Pepper and Mr. Pibb, but why would I want to knowing that Dublin Dr. Pepper and Dr. Dublin exist?Pop carries all sorts of boutique sodas, many with pure cane sugar as the major sweetener.  I used to love Coke, Pepsi, and even Royal Crown, but now I just taste bland high fructose corn water.  Thanks Pop the Soda Shop, for ruining everything."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325431),"Was here on a Saturday afternoon.  WOW, the place was popping!!!  It is bright, colorful, and clean.  The menu is on the wall.  There are so many things on it.  I settled with a Thai Iced Tea Slush + boba.  The bobas were soft and a good texture.  I am interested to try the other items on the menu."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323977),"Bad, just bad.Food is underwhelming. My friend did not like her wine after one sip and asked the waiter to exchange it for something else. He actually balked and said he would have to check with the manager before he could do that. What???Are you kidding me? Big mistake. Then I tasted my incredibly weak margherita, all sweet, horrible. Yea, they sell you an 18oz. drink, but whats the point if it sucks. Decided not to deal with the bartender directly instead of flustering our waiter again. Walked up to the bar and in a very calm, and nice way explained to the bartender that I was underwhelmed with my drink, that it was too sweet and I could not taste a hint of tequila. Well I guess tha was an insult, and instead of dealing with me as a customer, she told me that she made the drink and there was basically nothing wrong with it and nothing she could do. Really?This is the type of badly run, corporate restaurant I cannot stand. No owners to deal with, no one that cares, just crappy service and a culture that forgets about the customer. Owners need to go into a Houston's and see how a large corporate restaurant should be run."
ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325cba),"Beer and spam. Let's goo!I wanted to go here for a while and happened to walk in with some friends, not knowing the name. I looked at all of the different beers, the cool patio and interesting menu. Finally someone told me where we were and it all came together! This is a very cool spot, fairly unassuming from the outside. Once you're in, they have TONS of craft brews from across the country. Take your out-of-town friends here. Each have a decent alcohol percentage, so watch yourself.There is a good assortment of interesting items on the menu, including spam! Other dishes are pretty creative and add to the mystique of the place.  I wasn't able to spend much time here but can't wait to go back."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563244b2),"Greasewood Flat is hugely popular with winter tourists, and for cowboy ambience and entertainment it pretty much is in a class of its own.  Although they could, they don't charge outrageous prices to rip off the tourists.  Burgers are about $7 - 8 and beer is about $2.  They accept credit cards for the food but beers are cash only.If you are a local, Greasewood Flat is a great place to go on a weekday afternoon to get a good burger, a cold beer and have it somewhere other than a chain burger joint.  There were 3 of us a couple of days ago and it was HOT outside, so the place was empty.  The combo bartender/waiter/cook had a great friendly personality and our burgers were ready promptly.  Two of us had the special bacon/cheese/green chili burger which was served with lettuce, pickle, tomato and onion with a bowl of Ruffles.  The burgers are very large, but not those ridiculous things that some places show off with.  Just a good honest home-style burger, cooked perfectly.The Old West decor is honest as well, it doesn't look like a theme restaurant, it actually is old.  They have a VERY tiny dining room which is comfortably air-cooled, and decorated with hundreds of autographed dollar bills.  It's all very real.  Outdoor dining when it's 116 degrees is NOT very real, however, so please don't go there if you can't stand the heat and then complain how hot it was.The owner dropped in to say hi to us as we were leaving ... a nice touch."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56324809),"Hard Rock is just okay.  I have actually been to many many Hard Rocks, but not always to eat.  Usually we are only going to get a guitar pin from the different cities we visit because we know the food isn't that good.  The food is never bad, it's just never that good.Almost ever single time we go here, which I swear is too often, I order the Twisted Mac and Cheese.  I get this for two reasons.  One, I love mac and cheese, and two, I love cavatappi pasta.  HR's version of the classic cheesy pasta is a mildly spiced cheese sauce that lightly coats the curly pasta.  Don't expect to have a thick and creamy mac and cheese here.  You won't be getting that.  The pasta is then topped with the expected dry piece of blackened chicken.  Why expected?  It's expected because I have literally been to HR's all over the country, on both coasts, and every single one serves dry chicken.  I guess that's what they teach at the HR School of Cooking.  I guess they just put more focus on music than food.  Who knows.Why I gave HR three stars I will never know.  Why I keep going back is certainly beyond my capacity to understand.  Maybe they put crack in the mac.  That would explain why I order it time and time again.  If you haven't been, I suggest going just once.  It's fun to compare all the different HR's."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323a8a),"What better way to spend a night out on the town (downtown Phoenix style) than to over-indulge in a three course dinner at 1130, the Arizona Center's newest fine dining establishment? Their wine list and menu alone should be enough to intice you into trying this cool new locale out, but instead you get the added bonus of a warm and welcoming atmosphere, excellent service, and a hip. new urban vibe. Start off with an apetizer, which is half off during happy hour. I highly reccomend the Spinach and Artichoke dip served hot in a dainty au gratin dish along with tri-color tortilla chips. Their queso and crab dip is pretty stellar as well, packed with flavor, the calories in it are worth it! Lunch and dinner menus are slightly different, but cater to those on a budget and those who want to live a little. Vegetarian? Try the Veggie Platter! Grilled asparagus, a portabella mushroom steak, roasted tomatoes, rice pilaf blend, and the best sauteed spinach I have ever had in my life. This meal is inexpensive, filling, and can suit the needs of even the biggest meat eater. Is steak more your arena? 1130 may not look like the run of the mill Southwestern steak house, but they do compete with the best offering a multitude of rubs, toppings, and choice cuts. I highly reccommend their delmonico steak ""black and bleu"" style paired with a glass of pinot noir and vegetable sides. But don't forget to save some room for desert! Mango Key Lime pie is pretty decent, but it is all about their S'More Chocolate-- a warm fresh-baked brownie with grand marnier, toasted marshmallow, and whipped cream.

The food is decent and the interior is nice, but the tables/diners seem to be squished elbow-to-elbow New York style. Spartan, but slightly upscale, this restaurant ALWAYS seems to have a wait.  The yellow curry here is my favorite with a delicious balance of coconut, spice, carrots chicken and potatoes.  I can't ever seem to get enough, and I really mean that.  The portions here are small, and while lunch portions are expectedly small, portions elsewhere (at Chanpen Thai, for example) are larger and less expensive. Elsewhere the Thai BBQ chicken comes with 1/2 a chicken, but at Thai Basil they give you three lonely strips like cheapos!  The massaman curry and pad thai are pretty good too, but I feel they're just OK.  I've had better.Service is hit or miss here.  One thing that's consistent: they always seem to be understaffed. Once when I was dining alone (at a 4-person table) they had the nerve to ask me to move while in the middle of eating, to a 2-person table. To me, Thai Basil is style over substance.

It is sad because they have great food and I believe this restaurant would do much better if the service was up to par. My past visits were with the company. Excited to have our team building lunch at a downtown restaurant near the office is very convenient for our office. Sadly our office has not been happy with the service the two times we went as a team. This restaurant offers a variety of options to choose from for all types of diners. Salads, Sandwiches, Soups, Pizza and much much more. Though it seems the wait staff brings the place down. 1st securing a table ahead of time has not worked out for us both times because the restaurant did not have our reservation. Though the good news is both times we were able to get seated right away. The bad news is not only did our food take a long time majority of the orders were wrong. 2nd Giving them the benefit of the doubt I went in to place a to go order today. I placed my call order over the phone and was told It would take 15-20 minutes. After having my order repeated back to me and giving the correct spelling of my name I get to the restaurant to pay the tab to only find out my order was not even entered. The bartender tells me that the person who took my order forgot one of the items. I have trouble understanding this when I ordered only two items that were off the basic lunch special menu. To be proactive I paid my order ahead of time to find my name spelled wrong on the receipt. This again surprised me as the person who took the order repeated it back to me. After waiting 17 minutes for my order I find out from the bartender my order was made wrong. This was his fault as he entered it in wrong. He refunded me my money and I left because I could not wait another 15-20minuetes for a to go order. I am hesitant to give them another try at this point. I am not going to even risk catering for the office because part of my job is to order food for the office as the office I work in is a training center that provides food.

The space has a very odd layout, but there are two bars (one inside and one outside on the patio) and both have plenty of TVs to watch. There is also a very cliche mechanical bull, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one rode it while I was there.Service at the bar was really good, but when our group moved to a table, service became spotty. We had two servers for our table of 11 and one would take a drink order or would be asked for something and then not deliver it or something would get missed...the two servers just didn't coordinate very well. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and were a pretty laid back group. I only ate the Cadillac salad (mixed greens, tomatoes, cheese and croutons) and it was a nice size for $7.95. However, and maybe this is just a pet peeve of mine, but I hate when restaurants put the dressing on for you! I prefer for it to come on the side, as it does in almost every single restaurant I have ever been to, so I can put on as much as I would like. I did try a few of my friend's fries and they were good...not oily and for fries, they were actually pretty light. As a note, for groups, they put an automatic 20% gratuity on the bill, not the standard 18% most other places do.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place as a lunch or dinner destination as I was not impressed by the menu or the entree prices which seemed on the high side for what they were. However the three stars I am giving Cadillac Ranch are for their happy hour:$2 domestics$3 imports$3 Fat Tire bottles$3 Flavored Smirnoff Vodka drinks$3 Margaritas$4 Rum (Captain Morgan)$5 Vodka Martinis$3.50 to $5ish select appetizers (there are about four or five)I'm always happy when I can get Stella drafts for cheap. Also, according to the bartender, one of the margaritas they serve can only be purchased a maximum of 4 times by one person because it is so strong.

I'd just heard too many good things about the place to not at least give it a try.I ordered their white pizza (the idea of fresh mozzarella was too good to pass up) almost immediately upon sitting down.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563257a4),"Must declare the breakfast has been delicious on each of the four occasions I've dined here. If I was grading on food only, easily 4 stars. However, as good as the food is there is much not to like, as well. I have yet to experience friendly staff, especially at the counter. I think I noticed a hint of a condescending smile after the pony tailed brunette finished taking my recent order.  I understand the economy effects many sides of small business, but a friendly staff requires zero cost.  Especially after waiting in line in their cramped quarters. I actually think the customers are very friendly and that tends to mask the unfriendliness of the staffOn the above noted visit, I stood waiting for a table for awhile after ordering. I didn't think it would be long as I noticed a table ready to be bussed.  It was a larger table so I knew we would wait for a smaller one and give the larger one to another party, but kept my eye on it anyway as a last resort. The four gals behind the counter had a pause in walk up clients and all stood there staring at each other for a full 5 minutes before one decided to bus the table.  It looked like they were suffering from ""not my job"" syndrome.My other two major complaints are the closeness of the tables and the lack of patio heaters.  With an eager breakfast crowd that has no choice but to seek seating on the patio, wouldn't outdoor heaters be nice in winter months?  Seems like a no brainer to me when the seating is such an issue.This restaurant has an opportunity to be a really lovely breakfast and lunch spot, but someone needs to pay attention to these glaringly obvious shortcomings in basic restaurant hospitality.Update as of 12/5/11: Owner took the time to send me a note regarding my review. Very much appreciated the professionalism he showed in his note.  Seemed genuinely concerned about the impression his staff left on clients. He is working on heaters for the patio."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325471),"I discovered this place, on Yelp, by accident. I was searching some other item and this came up. I read the reviews and decided to try it. What luck! I met a buddy, a fellow food nut, for lunch here on a Saturday. There were a handful of people in the joint, including the small group in the back, who seemed to go out of there way to not notice us. We were not greeted right away, and had to ask the host/waiter if we should just pick a table. You definitely feel like an outsider walking into this place if you have never been there before. After we got seated, the friendly waiter gave us a few menus and took our drink order. We were only drinking water and he returned promptly with two small bottles of water. Noticing that we looked unfamiliar, the waiter asked if this was our first time here. We said yes and he proceed to thoroughly explain the menu. This was great since I wasn't really sure what I was getting into here. My friend and I both ordered the Cevapi (sausage sandwich) with onions. I ordered the large and my buddy ordered the ex-large. We both added the sour cream & the pepper spread. While we were waiting I noticed the decor & atmosphere of the place. The loud Bosnian music playing and the hand painted murals on the walls. I even noticed the plaques on the wall from the local soccer teams (my son is a soccer player). The small bar in the rear of the place was visited by a few Bosnian looking people speaking what I can only assume was Bosnian. The shelves behind the register were full of what appeared to be Bosnian goods. It was all very nice and added to the experience. Our food arrived and was amazing. The sausages, my friend and I agreed, were possibly a beef & lamb mixture. They were very tasty, and reminded me of the Armenian food I had tried once in California. I was a little disappointed to find out that they didn't use their own recipe for the sausages (shipped from CA), but was happy with them non the less. The bread was wonderful. The first bite took me by surprise. I compared it to a cross between a pita and Indian Fry Bread. The onions were served raw. I am not a raw onion guy (grilled is the best) but they did compliment the sandwich. The sour cream was standard issue and the pepper spread had a red bell pepper, possibly tomato taste to it that was also a good compliment. I should have gone for the ex-large though. Having a big appetite myself, I left feeling like I could have eaten a little more. Overall I was very happy with the food and hope to return to try some of the other fare. The service was what you would expect from a small place with only one waiter/ host, but the gentlemen was very informative and friendly. The atmosphere was nice and a little out of the ordinary, which I enjoy. The prices were pretty good I guess. My lunch bill came to just under $10. If you are looking for fine dining this is not it, but if you are looking for someplace different with good food this IS it."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b5632579e),"Treachery! Seek it out:Let me begin this review by saying that mine is not an indictment on this particular location but on every single P.F. Chang's I've had the misfortune of being dragged to.P.F. Chang's is effectively the Cheesecake Factory of bad Chinese food, with the disadvantage of not being as capable of delivering passable food. They bill themselves as a ""gourmet"" Asian experience, which is a bit of a laugh when they turn around and sell you their equally horrible frozen entr??es right from the convenience of your local Wal-Mart. Everything is bland, overcooked, and ridiculously priced. Once you've paid nearly $14 for their ""orange peel chicken"", you may privately hope to yourself that they might have the audacity to include some fried rice. This is your second mistake. Sadly, the bistro calls you on your bullshit. You get white or brown--fried rice is several dollars extra and not at all worth it.Everything seems to be cooked just wrong--things that shouldn't be are too crispy, things that should be sauced are too dry, things that should taste good make you question the will of the gods, all the while you find there's no way to escape the treachery.Things get more and more frustrating as you dig deeper: P.F. Changs, while sounding vaguely Asian, is a wholly American creation. It was founded by Paul Fleming (in Scottsdale, actually) with SOMEone with some Asian influence to spice it up a bit, named Philip Chiang. (They literally cut out the poor bastard's ""i"" so that it would ""fit on the signs better,"" or, as I like to believe, not scare away the flyover-states-white-folk so.) It's highly Americanized (and yes, I've had Chinese food in China, but I've also enjoyed great ""American Chinese"" food here) to the point of regrettable blandness and it is SO VERY EXPENSIVE you may find your credit score taking a ding after eating a plate of ""wok charred beef"", listed as one of the saltiest foods in America.The decoration is clumsy and their famous inclusion of terra cotta warriors are literally symbols of death. From Jennifer 8 Lee's Fortune Cookie Chronicles:'But not everyone finds the terra-cotta warriors charming. ""Chinese people would never put that in a restuarant,"" Jim told me, pointing at the statues. ""It's not lucky. It's something you put at a burial site! But in America, they think it's a Chinese thing."" From a Chinese perspective, P.F. Changs is decorated with death.'Which is just fine, because everything there tastes like death anyway."

Since I was new to the place I asked the bartender for a recommendation and he instantly told me to get the 190 Octane ($5.50)...I didn't know it had Everclear in it until I grabbed a menu a few minutes later and saw what was in it. Holy smokes! The drink itself was pretty strong, but easy to down because of the slushie-like consistency and orange color and taste.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325687),"I love international food and I am constantly trying it everywhere I go. Venezuelan food is that type of food that you either love very much or find no pleasure in eating it. This is also a type of food that you can find restaurants galore in Miami, New york City and L.A. I have several Venezuelan friends so I know exactly what a good Arepa tastes like, or a cachapa, hallacas, empanadas, etc. I decided to go to My Arepa because I had been craving for some Arepas and cachapas so I decided to pick up my mom and went to try this place. The place looks okay!! As long as it looks pretty clean, I am okay with the rest. So this place looked clean to me. I ordered a Parchita (Passion fruit drink). It was good and refreshing. $3 Then, I ordered Arepas (one of queso de mano-soft cheese and another one of Shredded beef). $4 each! They were okay but please agree with me that the price is too high for an arepa!!! My mom ordered a cheese and ham empanda for $4 and an arepa. I ordered cachapas (sweet corn cakes) for my kids. They are sweet and fluffy. I ordered them with soft cheese for $6 each! They were good but the price is TOO high!! These are probably the most expensive Cachapas I've eaten in my life. Not even in L.A. or Miami were that expensive...why is that? I don't know yet!! And lastly, I ordered Hallacas to go (a tamal like cake filled with all kinds of vegetables and wrapped in banana leaves). They were $8 each and I must say that I've eaten better ones. They usually sell them frozen to go because it is my understanding that someone from Florida makes them for the owner. So they are not fresh and it is obvious!!! Overall, the place is good but I would only go back if I am really craving Venezuelan food and don't feel like cooking it myself. The prices are outrageous I think. I also double check with my Venezuelan friends and they also think the prices are high!!!"

I have eaten at many restaurants and have to say there was some big short comings though.We tried a number of different items on the menu to share along with a few drinks. Sangria was ok...  nothing special and over priced.The service was really poor. When I say poor it came in a number of areas from being very slow to an arogent  attitude  to go along with it. When it took over 30 minutes to get our guacamole and chips brought out we asked one of the staff members why it was taking so long. I don't think I have every experienced such a rude way of dealing with customers but the guy was terrible. It was probably the worst way to have handled our inquiry about what was going on.  (can you tell it was not a good experience)Well the food finally came out  and as a rating on the food I would say it was average.It consisted of  good quality ingredients and tasted good.

The food received mixed reviews by our table. Three people in our party ordered the caesar salad after the waiter highlighted it. Their special twish was celery, which we all assumed was mixed in for extra crunch. It turns out the entire salad is shaved celery. The celery was just way too stringy and fibrous to really enjoy, plus it watered down the flavor of the caesar dressing. Nice attempt at a twist, but I would say leave that classic alone. On the positive side, I did really enjoy the burger - great flavor and the homemade chipotle ketchup was awesome (they also have homemade tarragon mustard). My cousin had the meatloaf which looked amazing. He's a 6'2' 16 year old athlete with a refined palate... I didn't even have a chance to ask for a bite before he devoured it, but he said it was awesome. My experience here was good (hence the A-OK rating), but didn't leave me wanting come back for more.

Read on to find out why...I LOVE mongolian stir-fry places - all of the cooking without having to buy the ingredients, clean up afterwards, etc. - so I was completely stoked to go to this place.  Unfortunately, after trudging through the rain this past Sunday night to get there, Genghis Grill was not the oasis I had hoped for.  I stepped out of the rain and into an equally dreary locale with lights that somehow gave the place a weird cafeteria-like aura.  The only way to describe the atmosphere is to say there is no atmosphere.  The grilling area, which you'd think would be the main focal point of a place called Genghis Grill, was all the way in the back and was completely deserted.  NO ONE was actually filling bowls up with food or having stuff grilled, which made me wonder how long all of the ingredients had been sitting there.  Averting my gaze from the sad cooking area, my eyes fell upon a random assortment of questionably groomed older people, with the odd straggly haired teenager thrown into the mix.  And why the flat-screen tvs on the walls?  It's not that I don't appreciate nice flat-screen tvs, but at a mongolian barbeque they just seemed a little...out-of-place.  The whole scene was just unappetizing, so we decided to go and find a more appealing place to dine (namely, Chipotle, which incidentally had a lot more atmosphere and was not deserted).  The comic relief was when I told the waiter we had ""to go,"" and he replied ""Oh, you can pick that up at the bar"" - to which I clarified ""No- I mean we're leaving.""  Probably never to return, unless I come to hear that maybe this was just an ""off"" night for the Genghis Grill..."

We were promptly seated to a clean table and I noticed the other tables were also getting cleaned quickly. Having worked in the industry for several years, I notice this sort of stuff and appreciate a quickly bussed dining room. Most of the staff are Spanish speaking but my gringo lunch pals had no problem getting by with their Spanglish and innocent, pleading looks. I scanned the menu and quickly spotted the ""home make corn tortillas"" for the quesadillas. I asked the server and she confirmed that this was only for the Estilo del Rey quesadillas. I'm a sucker for anything made in house- sign me up! She also guided me away from the pork and told me to get the chicken because it was better. I love having an interaction with someone who actually knows what they're talking about, so much better than a doe-eyed or aloof server saying ""everything is good"". When my plate arrived, I was really impressed with the presentation. The quesadilla took up half the plate, it was drizzled with crema, sprinkled with queso fresco, fresh cilantro and diced onion. It was served with a side of shredded iceberg and some lime wedges. I'm a firm believer in meaningful condiments, so if it comes with wedges dammit I'm using all of them. I juiced the limes and went to town. The steaming hot shredded chicken was perfectly cooked, sauteed with onions, spices and dressed with just the right amount of red chili. Slight warning- this is a little spicy but I would rate it close to a Valentino or Cholula-level. Coworker #1 got the Asada plate; the meat was bland and the beans were a little too creamy for my liking.  I quickly apologized to my quesadilla for straying.  Coworker #2 is a fellow foodie and had the shrimp tacos.

When my Mom was disappointed that her chile rellenos were too hot Roger said just to call him in the morning before we came and he'd prepare some where he'd take out all the seeds.If you happen to be in the Anthem area this is definitely the place to stop."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b56323fdc),"I came here last year (before I knew about Yelp) with some friends of mine.  We went during reverse happy hour, where the sushi and sake bombs were HALF OFF!  It cost about $34 for 2 rounds of 4 sake bombs and 3 very large sushi plates.  I think that's pretty awesome split between 4 people!"
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323bba),"My daughter and I were visiing the West Valley for family business and sorely needed a nice night out and some good food. Based on the Yelp reviews and our geographic location we decided to try Bella Luna. Things started out okay which earned them one of the two stars in this review. We were promptly greeted (although it was quite early - maybe 5 or 5:30?) and seated at a window table allowing us a view of the strip mall parking lot (ugh). The ambiance is a bit ghastly, colors leftover from some 80's idea of country Italian - lots of purple and green. Okay so maybe I'm being generous for giving them one star but we didn't turn around and leave at this point. Our waiter was pleasant enough, a gentleman who may or may not be the real thing Italian, however we were immediately overwhelmed by his aftershave!!!!Aaaaaaaack - eau de Old Spice.Seriously, I've never had someone serving in a restaurant smell so strong of perfume - ever! We ordered a much needed bottle of wine and were also brought the bread basket. I agree with another Yelper that it was dry and squished and there were only three pieces in the entire basket - it was never refilled, probably a good thing. We ordered the Antipasto Misto and big surprise....it was all from a can....about ten leaves from a canned artichoke, canned eggplant goo, canned red bell pepper strips, a couple of pieces of cheese and some dry meat product. Things were not looking real good.......but salads were okay, good size and well dressed, but nothing special. Entrees were goopy, crowded on the plate, and not identifiable - I think I ordered a sauted white fish with lemon sauce, can't remember what my daughter had. We waited and waited for our waiter and ordered desert (I don't k now, maybe I'm a masochist?). Got tiramisu and it was dry, off-tasting, possibly frozen and rethawed.  Waited a really long time for our check and by this time all I could really taste was the overpowering aftershave from our waiter. I cannot say anything good about this place but we ate the food (giving a second star as it was food and we didn't get ill) and am so sorry that there are not better eateries in the West Valley. We tried."
ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323c78),"Well, I've been to Liberty Market several times now and it's time to add my two cents. Yes, I know, there are already 250+ Reviews, what more could I add? Don't worry, I'll stick to the facts; consider this the cliff-notes version.Take the first parking spot you can find or drive the the lot west of the building. Walk in, grab a menu, and get in line.  With all of the goodness on the menu, try to make your decision before you get to the register.  A few of my favorites1. CORTADITO - coffee drinkers, do NOT miss this one!  Cuban miro-latte, on the sweeter side, served in a pair of espresso shots or a bowl, perfection!2. Rancher Salad - steak, caramelized onions, blue cheese, arugula, do I have to keep going?3. Sweet Potato Salad - a unique salad, SO much better than your average potato salad4. Cinnamon Rolls the size of a human face, if you're into to that kind of thing, share with a friend, or four.there are more, but I promised to keep it short.Back to the line. As you're making up your mind, be ready to answer the number of people in your party so they can set you up with a table.  Try to resist the incredible looking, super-sized pastries and desserts in the case, or not, what the heck, just get it!.  Pay the friendly cashier, proceed to the fountain drink station to fill your glasses, and maneuver the maze of tables to find the one with your number.Just a few tips.  One, it can get a little noisy in there, so may not be the best place if you're planning a discussion over your meal. Two, LM gets busy and the staff is always trying to find a table for the guests in line by the time they finish at the register.  So, while the dining room attendants are friendly and attentive, they are definitely trying to turn the table as soon as you'll let them.And now you know what to expect.  If you don't like lines or loud places, this might not be your favorite place. Overall, delicious, fresh food and shinny, happy people to bring it to you.  Let's just say LM is enough to get me out of my five mile Ahwatukee radius, and that is hard to do! Now you know the scoop . . . I'm out!  Enjoy!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56325306),"i love this place. the beef skewers are awesome, the mix plates are awesome, everything is awesome. seriously, awesome. mini plates will fill your tummy, the regular sized ones are great for having leftovers for breakfast. the wednesday/saturday kalua pig should not be missed. and the chicken long rice ... oh my god. the chicken long rice. this is the only place in town i've found it, and i love it."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563255e3),"I still like Lux better. Cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. The menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks. They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if that's what you're into.I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel ""art"" is pretty interesting and unique.This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here. The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324e9d),"I've been in the valley for almost a year and so far Sakana is the best sushi restaurant I've found (and I've been looking). First, the bad: on Friday night I met some friends at 7:30 -- we were a party of 4 and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. The wait ended up being over an hour, due to a couple of large parties just camping out after the bill had been paid. Keep in mind, this is a small restaurant. It would have been appreciated if the staff could have dropped subtle hints to these patrons that there was a slew of people waiting for their tables. Otherwise, the sushi is very tasty. The soft-shell crab roll is my personal favorite, and at around $9, an indicator that this place is easy on the wallet. Portions are large. Service has been consistently fast and friendly. The decor is simple and nothing ornate, making it feel like a nice  family restaurant. People were dressed in anything from gym attire to business casual. Sakana is on the top of my mind when I think of going out for sushi in Phoenix."

There was a to-go section of one lonely sandwich at 6pm Sat (so the good news is sales must be brisk), but we took the risk of ordering a hot sandwich = longer serve time (6-7min for a hot, 3-4 min for a cold.. I swear, I quote).  Though I teasingly hinted any expediting would be great (no other in line in front of us), I didn't see that communicated from the cashier to the gal making the hot pastrami and swiss.  Can I really fault them, no probably not.  And really, the cashier guy was uber nice from beginning to end.I asked them to wrap the 2 halves separately for sharing, and it was a tasty pastrami.  The casual patio atmopshere will definitely have me come back when I have time for a sit down."

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b5632437e),"We had a really lovely meal here to celebrate a friend's birthday.  I had never been to a Flemings, but I was impressed with the meat.  The price tag matches the quality, but then I feel like there is no reason to ever eat bad steak.  I actually had the scallops, my reservations in ordering steak came from a dining companion who told me Flemings was owned by the same people as Outback.  Then I tried my husband's ribeye.  Yum... perfect in every way.  The atmosphere is exactly what you want in a steakhouse, dark, cozy, a little bit of sex-appeal.  We sat next to the wine room, which I thought was a little awkward placement for a group of seven.  But maybe that was because we had made a last-minute reservation.  I would say Flemings is a great choice for a celebration or an intimate date."
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563256c5),"My husband and I decided to stop here yesterday for an early dinner and arrived around 5 PM. The place was pretty empty, so when the hostess asked us if we wanted a booth or table, I responded with: ""doesn't matter really, just a good spot.""Well the spot she chose was a booth right next to their big smoker that was as hot as a furnace and radiating that heat big time! Coming in from 113 degrees, I knew we were never going to be able to sit there, so when the waiter came to the table I asked (very politely) if we could be moved. He said he would 'have to check with the front desk' and drifted away. Finally he came back and said we would have to move to a table and we said that's great! And of course he moved us right next to a table with a screaming baby. Payback I guess for asking....Anyway, on to the food...I have to say that I was a little taken aback by the lack of any 'early bird specials' on food or beverages. In this economy even Flemings is doing a great happy hour! We ordered ribs (I had the baby back and my husband had the St. Louis) The waiter said we had 2 sides and I asked for a salad. He said that was not one of the choices, and it would be $1.75 more. OK. So I finally decided on the garlic mashed potatoes and the beans. The biscuits they brought to start the meal were really good with the honey cinnamon butter. But only 2? Come on, be a little more generous. The salads arrived and they were pretty much the stock salad, nothing fabulous. Then the plates came, and I have to say the BBQ ribs were just OK. Nothing great, and kinda dry. And the sides were fine, but nothing to write home about. I don't think I would have been so disappointed if it weren't for the fact that the meal (along with 2 large beers and NO dessert) was $80 before tip! Come on, that is ridiculous. We can eat at Joes or Daves for half that. So....will I return? No, probably not. If I am going to spend $100 for dinner, I can go to the Keg just down the way a little and get a much better meal."
ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325c73),"This has become one of my Favorite places to eat in Phoenix due to the great food and inexpensive prices. I have only tried Bun-Vermicelli #39 (BUN BO XAO --- w/stir fried beef, sprouts, lemongrass, peanuts and fish sauce) , #42 (BUN CHA GIO THIT NUONG --- w/eggrolls, grilled pork, vegetables, peanuts and fish sauce) and The Com Tam-Broken Rice #68 (COM TAM TAU HU KY DAC BIET --- Broken rice w/ shrimp cake wrapped in bean curd skin, bbq pork, shredded pork, egg, crab-egg cake).... all were very good with the #42 being my Favorite so far. The place is a bit risk-K looking from the outside but the inside is nice and clean, well lite with lots of Asian charm with a hint of a mom and pop dinner feel. I have also tasted the soup but not sure which one it was but it was D-lish for sure and they serve it in a huge bowl. Most every time I go there are several Vietnamese families dining there and they seem to favor the Soup. I would recommend to put this on a must try list and check out this great hidden treasure. I moved to this area in March of 2009 and am still learning where the good places to eat are for someone on a budget.

I had whatever was on special that one night only, and it was good. Me & my BF also had the fried buffalo mozzarella with sauce and that....that was delicious. The second time I went simple: Pasta with butter and pepper. I don't know how hard that is to mess up, but they managed to do so. I guess if you like to eat pepper straight from the shaker (or grinder, whichever you prefer) you might also like their rendition of pepper & butter noddles. But GEEEEEEEEZ, the pepper was so overwhelming, I couldn't finish and handed it off to my boyfriend, who loves spicy stuff, and even he said it was a bit too much. So against my better judgement, I tried it again. I ventured away from the pepper and went towards the lemon & butter pasta combo. All the while I'm thinking there is NO WAY they can mess up lemon, butter, and pasta. Oh, but they created another overwhelming masterpiece! I guess if you enjoy covering you pasta with lemon Pledge, you might enjoy this dish. It was like eating a lemon head. All I could taste was sour lemon with a hint of pasta. The mozzarella ball is delicious though. Expect to spend about $60 on 2 pasta dishes, an appetizer, and 2 glasses of wine. It's a bit redic."
ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563247ee),"A ski-lodgey pizzeria. This says it all. Well, almost. While the decor may be a bit ""weird"" and ""puzzling,"" make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.Let's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?DINNER:Arrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered ""All Day Happy Hour,"" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their ""Half and Half."" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. My family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. Overall, the food is average ""bar style"" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. JUST DRINKS:Now we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)As for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! Sure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. SO WHY GO? Uhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)If you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!"
ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324e9e),"La Grande Orange Grocery has a problem. It can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, and that makes the overall experience iffy. Is it a quick mart? A grocery store? A restaurant? A coffee shop? Unfortunately, it can't be all of them.I love La Grande Orange Pizzeria, when there is table service, fun wait-staff, and delicious food. But during the day on the weekends, the Grocery is too busy and unorganized to tolerate. It is not set up for the crowd, they do a poor job of line management, and when there is a line to order, the rest of the Grocery is impossible to navigate. To top it off, the counter staff shouts at you when your food is ready. Unnecessary.I'll certainly be back at night for the pizza, the delicious wings, and to partake of the best gelato shop adjacent to LGO. But I'm afraid that I won't be back for the weekend chaos."

Let me begin by saying that the food at Luke's is really good, i am a semi-regular customer. The Combo sandwich is my favorite, definitely something two people can share. We went for lunch yesterday in a group of four people. The other thing you have to know about Luke's is that it gets busy and there is not a lot of tables. We happened to look at the time as we sat down and noticed the time was 12:01pm. We ate our meals, and just as the last person was finishing the owner came and took our trays. We thought that was nice he is cleaning up for us. The he came back to the table and said ""if you guys are going to loiter and talk, there is tables outside. People are waiting for your table"" at which point I looked around and noticed that every body was seated at that moment. I haven't been accused of loitering since I was fifteen at the mall food court!  We got up and left, looked at the time, it was 12:19pm. WE WERE THERE FOR 18 MINUTES!!! It's not like we were going to stay much longer as we had to get back to work. I will definitely not be going back to Luke's again just based on the poor attitude the owner displayed yesterday."

You know the expression ""falling down drunk"", well I spotted several of those within 15 minutes. And they took the tables with them. Yet the the staff ignores it while the other patrons laugh and applaud.And I wouldn't recommend going on a Saturday night if you plan to eat in the dining room. You'll have trouble finding a table if you have more than 2 in your party. Now you might think I should've known better than to go with a group on what will always be a busy weekend night there but I was told when I called ahead that ""sure no problem we can fit 8 in"". The phone-answerer never offered to make a reservation, I got the impression The Lodge doesn't take them, but if it does he seemed to think one wasn't necessary.  Then we get there and are told there's no space in the dining room and they have no idea when there will be.The staff is friendly and that's the only reason this place even deserves one star.

Come on, let's hear it. If I must, let me start with the obvious. I cannot think of a more destitute and uglier part of town in all of Phoenix. OK, no problem, VanBuren street right next to the projects that is right next to St Luke's Psych Hospital, really that is no big deal. Hey, forget the images of when you were a kid and this area was infested with trans gendered She- Male prostitutes. Just forget that. Back to the review, went into the charmless Baize Market hoping to find the strange and alluring far away scents that one finds at Haji Baba.

Oh well, headed along the rows, and everything looked good with a nice selection of Middle Easter Staples and the best selection of Baklava I have ever seen. But back to Al-Hana. It reminded me of a type of cafe style one would see in NYC, or as Rand puts it the ""slums of Istanbul.""

Nice chair, like the way it wobbles from side to side....OK back to the food. Ordered the Chicken Kabob Plate, and a small side of hummus. After about 15 minutes it was ready. It was hot and fresh but I didn't care for the taste of the chicken or the hummus. They both appeared to be utilizing a heavy yogurt base to cook with and I hate that Yogurt stuff. The chicken was well cooked, the pita and the side vegetables were pretty good, but after seeing the Lamb heads in the butchers counter, I guess I just wasn't that hungry after all? Oh, the chicken was a hassle to get off the skewer BTW. The hot sauce on the table was reminiscent of watery wing sauce and that is a no-no in my book. Wing sauce and ME food, errrr maybe not so much. Employees seemed a bit on the miserable side too, just an observation. No bismati rice, that's cool, no salads, that's cool. No clean tables, that's cool, No ambiance, that's cool.

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563240c1),"wow! we finally found this place after 3 mos of salivating and anticipating. well let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. we accidentally stumbled in after riding around on bikes looking for a place with a byob policy. sure am glad the sushi place next door had a not so friendly or inviting bartender, otherwise we would have stayed and missed bread fruit! we were the first to arrive, so we had first choice... which was of course outside! only problem with the outside dining is the chairs with rounded legs on the grass, which was very shaky. other than that, everything else was great. we were riding around on bikes, and this was the first stop, so we went with a plethora of sides... and we were pleasantly surprised at the flavors and intricacies of each simple dish. they looked so simple, but tasted very true to the islands. I've been to jamaica and have to say that i felt sa though i had been secretly flown back there without my knowledge... only thing missin was the ocean. the simplest dishes were the best and most tasty. i mean it doesn't get any simpler than steamed cabage and peppers, but hello tasty coconut after taste. the dumplings were tasty too! i loved the sauce, had to try both, and i devoured them! the coleslaw was my second fav. very simple but filled with tons of flavor! sa the night progressed about 4 table tops showed up, so if i have to guess 7pm is a great time to go and be served fast. yes you can take ur own wine, not sure about beer. since we were biking and didn't want to ride full, i didn't do desert. however next time im trying the pudding! enjoy this hidden treasure, i sure did."

Here's why you're gunna grab a Bunna:-You're gunna wanna chat with the nice folks at Bunna.-Their coffee is very good and shade grown but you can drink it in the sunna.-Here at Bunna they really know their stuff and you can get toddy at Bunna.-It takes real coffee expertise at a coffee house to even know what toddy is - go to Bunna and try it.-Gabi's office hours at Bunna brought me here in a roundabout way.-Meet with a friend is what I was gunna, he said hey let's meet over at this place I tried with Gabi, do you know it, it's called Bunna.*Toddy - coffee brewed by soaking the grounds in cold water for 12 hours or so, then draining off the liquid.  The result is highly caffeinated, very smooth, concentrated coffee which can then be used in drinks in place of espresso or consumed on it's own.  It is very smooth because no hot water or steam is used as in regular brewing methods and the bitter acids that are released from the beans by heat are not present in the toddy."

My date and I seated ourselves and it took awhile for us to be helped. This is just one thing out of a myriad of other reasons I should only give Paisley 1 star. They get 4 stars because the one girl who was helping us was trying to handle the entire restaurant. And we were informed the one girl cooking all the food had been doing it 12 hours straight. With this in mind, we were quite impressed by the level of service. Another winning point was the ambiance of the place. My date remarked a number of times about how cute it is. She's right.

The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.

They sort of teetered the totter that was heavily leaning in the direction of ""the people are losing the fight in Phoenix.  Corporate takeover is assured.""  Breath of fresh air to walk in and see a lot of the same wait staff that has been there for several years.  That says a lot.  The food is delicious.  Very fresh.  Very artisan, far from run of the mill, but still simple and not overly ridiculous.  The portions are large.  Large sandwiches, enormous delicious salads.  The servers are full of fabulous suggestions, and their daily specials are amazing.  I've been there many times, and I don't think my beverage has ever gotten empty without being offered a refill, and they have never failed to check back with me to see how everything tastes.I always tip extremely well here, because it is deserved.  In fact, I randomly ran into one of the servers at another establishment, and he just couldn't think of where he knew me from (me either) and then his eyes got bright and he said, ""Oh wait!  you come into My Florist!  You're a great tipper!"".  So next time you are pondering whether or not to leave the extra coupla dollars (c'mon, you know you'll just blow it on something stupid), leave it for your server when provided with great service.

ObjectID(5165b71b74c3068b563243bc),"I heard about this great restaurant, serving Rustic French Country cuisine, by a good friend of mine. He raved about how wonderful Metro Brasserie was and knowing him and his tastes, he usually isn't too far off the mark. So when I had the opportunity to pick a place for my girlfriends and I to meet, I thought what a perfect place to check out. Metro Brasserie is located in Old Town Scottsdale near the chic Waterfront.  The Waterfront is surrounded by trendy boutiques, cafes and wine bars and it's a bustle with Phoenician hipsters and tourists alike. We were all really excited to try this hip new place and feeling our stomachs grumble couldn't wait to indulge our taste buds in yummy delights. It was a little bit busy, after all it was a sunny Sunday afternoon, during the busiest time of the day. We were told the wait would be around 40 minutes for the patio and 20 minutes for interior sitting. Without hesitation we decided interior seating would be best...did I mention we were all really hungry? Within 15 minutes the hostess seated us. The restaurant was super cute and reminded me of some of the little french cafes at home, back in Canada. Thoughts of Pomme Frites, Poutine and Croque Monsieur danced through my head.The menu had a pretty nice variety of entrees on it and you could order either breakfast or lunch. I really like when restaurants give you options. By the way, who doesn't like a good breakfast?? That's a whole other conversation. Anyway, back to Metro Brasserie - the waiter came to take our order, my friend couldn't decide between the French Toast and the Quiche. Who better to ask then the waiter! My friend proceeds to tell the waiter she's torn between two items.""French Toast or Quiche? Which is better?"" Seemed like a pretty normal kind of question for a waiter. His response blew us away. ""Well, they're really different. One is sweet and the other savory."" The table is silent and I'm sure we're all thinking the exact same thing...no shit! It was at that moment our excitement was replaced with disappointment and a hint of irritation. Not only was the waiters personality drier than toast but let's just say he was seriously lacking character and manners. We all put in our orders; a Burger for me, Belgian Endive Salad with chicken for my friend and the Mushroom Brie Quiche for my other girlfriend. An hour and twenty five minutes went by and no food. Our waiter didn't stop by during that time at all - you think he would have advised us of a problem in the kitchen or even just apologized for the delay. Nothing! Our food finally arrives and we begin to devour what seems like a precious jem. The burger was cooked perfectly, medium rare with Gruyere and the Pomme Frites and mayo were amazing. The Quiche on the other hand was just okay, ""nothing special"" and the Belgian Endive Salad with chicken was not the best. Apparently, the Salad was also nothing special and had a strange flavored dressing on it that was clearly not enjoyable. We finish eating and chatting and decide to call it day. Mr. poo poo waiter hadn't been by to check on us and after having had waited so long for a mediocre lunch we weren't terribly happy.  The service was blatantly awful, the waiter was rude, and only one dish was really good...what to do? Being the somewhat decent consumer, we decide to leave a 10% tip. Anything less would be pretty rude considering most of the food industry lives off the tips. I could not bring myself to leave this fine establishment without saying something, I wrote a little note on the receipt that said ""This is the worst service I've ever experienced!"" I really felt compelled to say something about our experience. We're in the middle of a recession and eating out is a privilege that should be enjoyed. So, shouldn't patrons be treated well when spending money in establishments?"

Got home and opened up our packages to a huge disappointment.  I ordered the South of the Border omelette and couldn't believe that the fruit and sour cream were both thrown on top of the omelette.  The fruit should have been packaged separately (hot and cold don't belong together) and the sour cream should have been in a cup by itself.  The pepper jack cheese in the omelette was of the processed variety (think Velveeta.)  I would think that a place that tries to be higher end would use quality ingredients.  The second order was fried chicken and waffles but that's all we got.  No butter, no syrup.  So instead of eating our meals we had to make a trip to the grocery store to buy syrup since the restaurant was too far away.  When I called the restaurant to point this out I was told (after a very long and awkward pause) that the chicken and waffles would be taken off the bill."

If I don't like a place I don't usually give it a second chance but  because I like to support local businesses and so many people rave about Macayo's I did try several locations.  Everyone says the one off of Mill Ave is good.  But I have wasted enough money at their restaurants.  It boggles my mind how a chain of such low quality can exist.  Any one of the numerous Mexican restaurants usually ending with ""o's"" is better than this place.  The reason they have big margarita's is to distract you from the horrible food and hope after you get over your hangover the margarita is all you remember. Everything I have tasted is bland and seems like it came out of a can.  This chain helps perpetuate the stereotype of Mexican food being of low quality.  I am Mexican-American and used to changing people's mindset when I have them over for dinner.The only nice quality of this location is the building is unique it looks like a mesoamerican  pyramid."

The atmosphere. Most Pita Jungles tend to have a more bohemian look. Very artsy, but not very chic. The Desert Ridge Pita Jungle instead goes for a very contemporary look. As my girlfriend puts it, this is the ""yuppy"" Pita Jungle. There's a bar with big screens above it playing sports in HD. The lights and decorations all look like they are at a chic new hot spot.

I liked the coconut mungo dish, pork lumpia & atchara. They were out of their #5 which had the bbq pork & chicken...would love to try that if ever there is occasion to be in Phoenix...but, I don't think we'd go out of our way, just for Hey Joe's again. The banana-que was alright for me. I like mine sweeter encrusted with caramelized sugar. Hey Joe's is lightly caramelized. But we did eat four banana-que! It was cold out & the warmth of the banana-que's hit the spot. I also tried the Adidas/chicken feet. I liked the crispy skin, but just couldn't bring myself to eat the chewy sinews between the tiny bones. The atchara's crunchy, sweet/tangy coldness helped ease the Adidas experience."

OK admit I liked him because he played Dylan and Leonard Cohen among others. I was enjoying the vibe until, as the evening grew darker, I realized we could not see our food, like, at all. A single small candle was not adequate to light our table. That really is my only complaint and I think it is repairable. It was hard to love on my food when I seriously couldn't tell what was what. So much effort clearly went into making the food, so come on, let's see it.My other comment is the serving sizes. I expected that a menu such as the restaurant week menu might have smaller servings and they definitely could have. Nearly everyone I saw leaving was taking a box with them, as we did. With full size appetizers, we only ate half of our full sized main dishes. BF had to bring his dessert home, although I pressed on to try the chocolate chile torte with the most amazing malt and coconut ice cream. Not seeing it added a kind of different taste dimension which wasn't Unpleasant but it was a bit unusual.I enjoyed all of the food but the big hits for me were the renowned pork pernil and the corn bread casserole thingy...well it's not typical cornbread but very rich and home style with chiles and other unseen bits.Will go back next time I'm in Phoenix but will likely see if we can split a meal, saving room for the excellent desserts. Last, not least, I found the texting reservations very easy and a great idea for those places that may not want to deal with Open Table."

They use the real Mexican cheese -- queso fresco.  None of that oily American crap served at just about any other so-called Mexican food restaurant out there.

Authentic Mexican salsa isn't; if it is, it's called pico de gallo. Their chips are certainly decent enough, but I don't go there for the chips.Their wait staff has gotten to know me and while they've always been very nice, they really warm up even more when a friendly face comes to eat.  The staff isn't perfect and sometimes they get frazzled, but the food is always consistent -- always!A friend who never likes to eat at Mexican restaurants because they never taste like his grandma's, always loves Restaurant Mexico.

Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews. This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else"

We walk in at 12:10 to a nearly empty restaurant, I first try to use the bathroom, and the light wasn't working... that should have been my first clue. 2. We sit down and a few minutes later the place is packed, but for some reason everyone has been help except us!?! 3.

I ordered the Sonora Arrachera Taco, and told them about the MOLDY chips, he apologized and took the chips away.  The original waitress came back, apologized for the chips, and said she would comp the drinks, I returned the horchata, and got a Sierra Mist as well (also came in a to-go cup, there's a reason I am mentioning this)6.

The service would was horrible and the owner just downright rude. I went there for a lunch with a couple of friends and was informed rather rudely that they only have a buffet for lunch. This was disappointing since I had my heart set on certain traditional dishes some of which were part of the buffet already. The owner couldn't seem to care less whether we stayed or left and pretty much seemed to give us an ultimatum to either eat the buffet or leave. It being late we decided to try the buffet was sub-par. Barely an item I could think of going back for... In short avoid it if you can. The service makes its not worth it.

The pizza and salads are my favorite, and of course one cannot forget the glutenous wonder of the pizza cookie (formerly the pzookie).

The strip mall location across from the un-hip PV mall doesn't bely the fantastic experience inside. I've eaten there many times throughout the years and it never disappoints. Since leaving PHX, its been a couple of years since I stopped through, but this experience felt like a homecoming. Why do I bother with other ""trendy"" locations when my old friend stays consistently great?The tortilla soup is EXACTLY what it is supposed to be. If you get it, don't skimp on the sour cream and avocado because the extra calories are well worth it. The broth itself is flavorful if simple, the tortilla strips are toasted THEN added to the soup and its just too good for words.  I also had the fish tacos on this trip - I usually don't eat fish tacos, there is nothing worse than a place that messes up such a simple dish, but La Parilla didn't disappoint. The tortillas are soft and pliable, the fish was remarkably good and the batter wasn't too over powering. They don't heap 12lbs of junk on it, they just let it shine. They keep the fresh chips coming and the ""green"" salsa is so good, I usually ask for additional to take home.  I have had the Parilla Suiza that other Yelpers love and I concur with their assessments too. And on our last trip, during a fairly busy lunch, we are greeted with warmth immediately both at the door and by Hector our waiter. He practically TRIPPED over himself to give us great service. Never rushing, just making sure everything was great. He made recommendations and honestly, made me feel like I was in the large home of a great cook. I just think the food here is underrated, its simple, fresh and well done. The service is always warm and prompt..and I now that my green salsa is gone, I guess I will have to wait until I am in PHX again for anything even remotely so good. If you haven't been, you should. Prices are reasonable, the staff is great and the cooks are confident enough to let the food stand on its own without layers of junk.

This place does have a helluva lot of sauces to choose from, though, if you're adventurous. Their Happy Hour menu isn't anything impressive. Not at all. Yucky American beer, like Bud, counts toward the $3.25 pint. Nothing else does. They do have a great Honey Ale and also offer Moose Drool here, as well as Orion, the best Japanese beer you'll find. And it costs $7.50 for the 22 oz, whereas you'll pay $9.00 for the same at Kabuki.They also have a short sushi menu. It's not too impressive, but it's enough to pique your interest. I really loved their Rainbow Roll. Maybe it's b/c we sat at the bar, but we barely got any service. And it began to annoy me. We had to ask for water. We had to ask to order.

Uhm, maybe, since they do have a couple good beers available, they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from...

So already this wasn't going to be the best experience ever.The two stars I'm giving were for the first time I called to see if they would just do a ceaser salad w/chicken to go. I called around 2, not knowing this was a dinner only restaurant, but the lady I spoke to said she could prepare the salad for me, just not the chicken because the cooks weren't even in yet. She was very nice and I appreciated her willingness to accommodate me HOURS before they even open. But I decided to skip it, not wantging her to go to the trouble when they were closed. On her own, this lady was 4-5 stars,  and I wished I would've just had her make the salad. Ok. Skip ahead a week. Now I'm sick and call about 8 at night to see if I can pick up the salad on my way home from work. I'm told they don't do to go orders. I tell the girl I spoke with someone last week and she said no problem, so this girl puts me on hold to speak w/ a manager. She comes back and says yes to the salad, no to the chicken because they have no way to cook it. So, within 1 week, a restaurant has lost the ability to cook a chicken breast. Really? .... so I ask for a cup of hot tea, since I'm sick. She says ""I promise you, there is no way I can give a to go drink"". Oh, but I can take a teabag if I really need it.I tell her to forget the whole thing. Way too difficult of a conversation, especially when 1)I'm ill and 2) a week earlier it was no problem.

The pizza is passable, but you do not go to Organ stop for the pizza.To enjoy Organ Stop, you must be a music lover. I mean the band geek variety. I was lucky enough to get my father here before he passed away, and every time I go since I reminisce in his enjoyment, in my parents enjoyment of a wide variety of music.For the uninitiated, the location at 1149 East Southern Avenue in Mesa is built to house a Wurlitzer Organ (OK Mike, try, try to avoid the huge organ jokes) with over 6,000 pipes. Additionally, percussive and horn instruments are tied to the instrument, not to mention the dancing cats, singing birds, disco ball and bubble machines. Keep in mind, one person operates this thing. I know they do have the ability to sample and replay the different overlays, but it's still very impressive stuff. I've seen three or four musicians in my many visits, my personal favorite in Charlie Balough.The crowd varies between kiddie and senior, and can be especially senior during snowbird season. After it warms up a bit, it's much easier to get in, sit down, eat mediocre pizza and drink a pitcher of beer while you list to an artist play a wide assortment of musical selections. I've been there many, many times, and it's a consistent experience. Enjoy yourself and teach your kids to appreciate music."

It is not, however, a great restaurant for people who are looking for a great meal in general. It fills a niche, but if you're not in that niche, it is solidly mediocre.We tried Nourish last night for dinner. Overall, the ambience is lovely, with the surrounding Optima landscaping sending wafts of perfumed air down onto the comfortable patio. I think there was only one server, and he did a fine job, but we would have appreciated quicker service, since we were trying to get to Tempe for a show and informed him of that at the outset. The food was good with an asterisk. As mentioned above, if you're used to not being able to eat anything on a menu because of food issues, this place is probably a Godsend. However, none of us has allergies and we all felt that our menu items were OK at best, and downright bland in some cases. There was simply nothing that stood out as amazing, or even memorable. Finally, I have to make a comment on the dinnerware. The plates were very cute and obviously chosen by someone with an eye for design. The same can be said for the general decor of the restaurant and the furniture. So why, I ask, were we given flatware of similar quality to the local elementary school cafeteria? You know, the kind you'll find wrapped in a paper napkin at the hole-in-the-wall Mexican dive that you can bend with one hand. The kind that has forks whose tines are practically in the same plane as the handle and are almost always slightly bent so that you get that uncomfortable sensation of biting a tine that you didn't expect to be so close to your teeth...I was actually really perplexed by this phenomenon, in case you hadn't noticed. Also, some people at our table had forks that didn't even match the rest (but equally poor quality.) The only thing I can think of is that they were trying to continue to the general theme of recycling/reusing/employing good karma practices, and they've repurposed the flatware from a kid's play-set or something. Probably won't be back.

Always received great service and was seated in a timely manner (even during rush time) I just went here with a girlfriend a couple of Fridays ago and it was awful. I would give it one star except I'm hoping this might be a one time thing however many signs indicated it is not. The wait was AT LEAST 30 minutes long, thinking it was worth it we waited, saw some friends and they got sat at a table large enough for us all to sit together so we only waited about 20. We were sat outside after being told there were misters to keep us cool. the misters were about 9 ft high and pointing in the wrong direction so we all sat there in an uncomfortable humid state of sweat. We asked multiple times for extra menus and place settings and did not get them until AFTER our food was served. No soy sauce on the table had to wait for that too. My friend and I ordered sake bombers and they gave us water glasses instead of bomber glasses...they said they kept breaking so they don't provide them anymore. What kind of sushi restaurant does not have the appropriate glasses for bombers? They must be really struggling financially. Our server was dull and unenthusiastic, no desire to please. Asked for more water and got it about 15 minutes later. If I wasn't enjoying the company so much I probably would have lost it and asked to speak to a manager. Server also didn't get my friends order right and so they didn't get one of the rolls they ordered until we were almost finished eating. Also they took away the mushrooms in the veggie tempura one of my fav items, big bummer for me. We didn't dare order desert even though we wanted it. All of us are very good tippers and we couldn't even decide if this server deserved a tip. We ended up leaving 15% instead of 20-25%.

We were seated in a big booth with plenty of room.THE FOOD: We ordered the cheese fondue appetizer. The bread and apples were great in it, but we were a bit confused by the pulled pork on the side. Should we stir it in? We ended up putting it on top of the bread after being dipped in the cheese.I had the Windsor burger. I have read reviews treating it like it was the second coming. I wouldn't go that far, but it was a good burger. Juicy and obviously hand formed, with smoky carmelized onions and the rest of the fixins. The fries were suprisngly tasty, not just a throw-away side dish.Others at the table had the pastrami sandwich which was proclaimed ""interesting"", but very tasty.THE SERVICE: Adequate.

When I do, I tend to go an binges, scarfing down food from one or two of my favorite spots, and adding a new place that has been on my must-try list. This time, it was La Condesa. Everything about La Condesa took me by surprise, regardless of the high expectations I already had. I loved its interior--the small space, the rustic wood furniture, the artwork, everything. A big departure from the usual feel of cheap-mexican restaurants/taquerias, it felt homey, warm, inviting. I was expecting to just shoot a quick order to the girl at the counter, but instead got table service, and extremely friendly and attentive service to boot (sounds like it's usually an order-at-the-counter place, though). On to the food: don't expect the usual suspects at the salsa bar--these salsas and toppings were phenomenal. I didn't ask, but I suspect they were all made in-house, and seemed incredibly fresh and were really a unique assortment. A great mellow, nutty peanut sauce, smokey chipotle salsa, creamy/salty cilantro, an awesome Mexican (or was it Mayan?) salsa (my favorite of what I tried)...my only regret was not sampling more.What I loved about the menu were the unique options that branched far beyond the usual suspects. I went with three tacos: tinga, mole, cochinita pibil. When they arrived, all of them looked beautiful, and were surprisingly and thankfully chocked-full of meat. I took one bite of the mole and...HO...LY.....SHIT. Ever go to a restaurant and casually take a bite of something without giving it too much thought, only to be immediately punched in the face by its deliciousness? I love it when this happens. It's one of those pure joys in life, and happens far too infrequently...but it happened here. I'm a sucker for any type of mole, but sometimes they fall a bit 'flat'. This one did not. It had a fantastic bite and complexity to it that really elevated the mole to one of the best I've had. The tinga and cochinita were both equally great. The meat in all three was insanely tender and flavorful from the great sauces they had simmered in.I paid the bill--$9.80--and realized that it was an awesome deal. Sure, you can find tacos in town for less than $3/ea, but they will not be like these. Not to mention, the portions were generous, I got free chips and a run at the salsa bar. I drove home feeling like I was teetering on the edge of purging...this was, after all, my second substantial meal in the course of 1 hour.

Nursing Home Food Alert***So bland I am not going to send this review to any friends on Yelp or anywhere.With all these decent reviews I wonder if I am reviewing the same or right place as say Arlin or Eli??  Went here before Costco, because he all know what happens when you go to Costco hungry right?I also wanted to get some sliced sourdough bread for dinner which I did.OK, this food had no taste.  Bland, boring, cheap ingredients.  No spices, no fresh spices, soup tasted like something from a can or mix.  The soup was a starchy mess.Had the half and half dreadful special.Half chicken salad, very dry and very skimpy on the chicken salad. Comparing that to Paradise chicken salad, I would give Not so Wildflower a 1/10 and Paradise a 9/10.  Both in terms of quality and quantity.  It was also seriously flavorless.I always wondered why people in nursing homes suffered from so much depression, and I think it has something to do with the starchy, bland, boring food they serve people in those places.My wife had the BLT the chicken dumpling soup.  Again, bland, sloppily put together and tasteless.Seriously people 5 stars for this crap??  Really??Skip this dump and go to Paradise where they at least flavor their food and make the salads in front of you.The staff looked miserable here too. Crappy, the water tasted like chemicals and added lemon which gave it a lemony chemical taste.  Not good.  Tried to spice soup up a bit with pepper as they don't have hot sauce in bottles like PARADISE.One star for not making me ill and one star for the sliced loaf of sourdough.Won't be back, yuck.Ps something seriously changed in the quality in the 2 years since I was last there?Update: 1/28/2012Lous the owner has responded and I wish I knew how to post our back and forth but don't know how to do it yet.  Either way, I am very impressed with his taking my concerns seriously and have bumped up to 3 stars for his great responses and his donation of my refund (I didn't want one really) to a no kill animal shelter.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563254da),"If any restaurant were to rate a 0, it would be Someburros.  Between slow service and not being able to make a custom order, the white girls that run and manage this restaurant need to take a lesson from some Hispanic folk who run a home-owned operation.On arriving at the Someburros location in Tempe, 4:00 PM on Sunday afternoon, I observed about 1/3 of the tables had someone sitting there...all eating or waiting.  There was one person at the counter schmoozing with one of the order chickies...not placing an order, just speaking to her in a quietly nasty nasal voice.  The other chickie was bouncing between the drive-thru and the phone, while first girl flirted obliviously...I stood at the register for 2 minutes before chickie who was flirting realized I was ready to order.  She meandered over and asked what I wanted, for here or to go.  Being on the guacamole burrito quest, I let her know I wanted to order a custom burrito, specifically that contained guacamole, bacon, cheese, sour cream and raw onion. 4:04 PM I have a receipt for the order.Chickie created a 'burro' that was a Bacon&Egg Burro (3.85) with no potatoes, no egg, add  guacamole (1.35), add Sour Cream (.96) and onion (.15) for a total after tax of $6.89.  Chickie asked me if I wanted salsa and marked my receipt.  I moved back to a position in proximity to the delivery station.  Orders older than mine moved out through the line.  Several large orders made their way out and folks received them to carry home.  4:16, I am called...I picked up my order and headed out to pick up the Valley Metro Limo.Once at home, I opened up the burrito I received based on my order.  This was a 10"" tortilla with cheese, sour cream and raw onion.  The meat I received had no visual resemblance to bacon.  It is a most unusual preparation of meat.  There is gristle in addition to fat and chunks that are bigger, have different consistency and remind me strikingly of ham.  There are pieces that feel and taste similar to bacon...just hard to know what it is I am eating.Most glaringly absent: guacamole.  I picked up my receipt and called the restaruant.  Michelle answered and asked immediately if she could put me on hold.  I asked how long she expected it to be and only heard a click in reply.  2 minutes later, Michelle picked up again and asked if I could hold.  I asked if I had to and she replied ""Yes"" before making the phone click again by putting me on hold.  2 minutes later, Michelle picked up again and told me to ""Please hold"" and pushed the button before I could reply.  When Michelle picked up for the 4th time, I cut her off before she could say ""Please Hold"" again by asking if the manager was available.  She said she was, laid the phone down (without putting me on hold) and went to get the manager.   Next, white girl Sara picked up the phone and asked how she could help me.  I shared that I was in about 30 minutes prior and ordered a custom burrito.  She said she remembered, and called me by name.  I told her the burrito had no guacamole and she asked me if I could return to the restaurant so she could give me the guacamole.  I advised I was riding the bus and the next round would not be available for over an hour.  She told me to hold onto the receipt, write her name on it, and next time I was by, she would give me a portion of guacamole.  I asked if the restaurant was busy and she replied that it was steady.  ""Is it reasonable, then, for me to have waited 6 minutes and been put on hold 3 times?"" Sara said that the girl running the phones may have been a bit overwhelmed and that it would not happen again.I am certain it will not happen again as I highly doubt I will waste my time returning to a hispanic restaurant run by white girls."

There are many varieties to choose from: black, oolong, green, flavored teas, and chai (to name a few).  I strolled in one Saturday night to satiate my craving for a chai tea latte.  My hopes were shot down when I was told they ran out of the mix for chai.  How does a tea place run out of chai?!  I took a menu to a table and debated which alternate would be a close match.  I decided to ask another employee if they could make the chai tea without milk.  Yes, it was possible.  No chai, my ass.  The tea was pretty good, but it was incredibly hot.  I'm no tea connoisseur , but I thought that tea should be steeped in water that isn't scalding so that the full flavor of the leaves could steep.  Maybe that was why it wasn't as flavorful as I'd expected. If you're in the mood for a bite, there are also a few sandwiches and salads.  I have yet to taste them.  There weren't many places to sit so I decided to grab a chair outside by the fireplace.  If you're in the mood, I recommend strolling around Barnes and Noble with your tea.

Yesterday, I finally convinced her to go back (with an assist from her sister, who is a fan).  We arrived right around 6:00pm and the wait was 30-35 minutes for a table  (Note:  This was odd as they have a patio with 5-10 tables, yet it didn't appear that they were seating anyone out there...not sure if it was because it was so windy?).  We decided to put in a order to-go instead.  Twenty five minutes later, our order was ready.We ordered the Mamma's Signature pizza, which comes with baby spinach, diced tomatoes and garlic.  On the way back, I  was worried that the pizza wasn't going to be as good as I remembered and that I had built it up too much in my mind.  Nope, it was still delicious.  The nice sweet sauce and the crispy crust on the outside, it was great.  (The middle pieces seemed to get a little soggy, but I blame that on the drive home, rather than anything Spinato's did...).  Even the wife said it was better than she remembered, so it looks like there may be more Spinato's in my future!  The only downside was that we did not order any of their delicious garlic bread (one battle at a time!).  I give Spinato's four stars due to the deliciousness of the pizza and the fact that I'll likely make return visits.

The restaurant is smaller than the average Pei Wei, and seems to be more of a fast food atmosphere.  This location is missing the quality of the other Pei Wei restaurants.  They only offer the basic items from Pei Wei and none of the newer promotional item like the Diner Selects I was looking for.  It is missing some of the fancy touches that makes Pei Wei more desirable than Panda Express.  Food was good, but not quite what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a high quality Pei Wei, try an Asian Diner, not the Asain Market version.  Not bad to eat at, but not interesting enough to recommend."

The name itself ""Revo Burrito, Revolutionary Mex"" set me up thinking I was walking into...a revolutionary burrito joint!  My husband and I were disappointed to say the least.  He had the Chicken Machaca Burrito, which the counter girl said was her favorite.  And it was, well, just a chicken burrito, at best.  There was so much liquid oozing out the bottom from the wet lettuce and wet pico that he had to move his chips to another plate because they were swimming.  I had the Black Bean Burrito.  The menu had stated the beans were slow simmered in garlic, onions & seasonings...sounded delish!  However it tasted like they walked next door to Safeway and bought a can of black beans, heated them up and rolled them into a tortilla.  It was also supposed to include their ""special cheese blend"" AND there was only a SLIGHT SPRINKLE of cheese...literally!  I actually opened up the tortilla to make sure they didn't forget it.  Call me crazy, but when I order a bean & CHEESE burrito, I'd like to have at least a small amount of cheese.  I guess their idea of special cheese is magical, disappearing cheese.The rice with corn & a drizzle of cream was especially delicious & the fresh-squeezed lemonade was tart & perfectly sweetened.

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323343),"What even is the real name of this restaurant? Is it Kanpai as written on the door? Is it Kampai as written on the sign? I actually have no idea and for the sake of this review, it doesn't really matter. Here is what is important about this little restaurant on the west side of town. The two chefs who own and run this restaurant, brought sushi to the valley. No, I am not kidding and its not debatable, AJ and Yuki are the original gangsters of the sushi manifestation that has occurred in Phoenix. In order to understand this revelation, we need to go back to 1985(see what I did there). A small sushi restaurant opens in Paradise Valley, right across the street from the mall. It is called Shogun and for many years is the premier sushi restaurant in the valley. Actually, for a while, it was the only sushi restaurant in the valley. Shogun has gone through various restorations and renovations over the years, but originally, it was AJ and Yuki at the small sushi bar inside Shogun with around five or six tables. These sushi geniuses built Shogun into the dynasty that it was and after a few years, moved onto their own venture, named Kampai or Kanpai, depending on which signage you are currently viewing. Kampai, found in a very shady strip mall on Bell road, has the best sushi in the valley. There is not a close second. Yuki is the main sushi chef and AJ runs the back end kitchen. Word of warning and the reason for the lack of five stars in this review. If Yuki is not your sushi chef, I cannot vouch for the restaurant at all. I know I know, that sounds brutal, but it's the truth. Yuki is an artist and meticulous. The other chefs just are not in his league and some of the specialties of the house, only taste their best when made from Yuki's hands. What makes this place so special? It certainly isn't the decor, which could not be more plain. It is far from the waitress service that is at best, hard to understand. It is the fact that the spicy tuna hand roll is the best I have ever had. The southwest salmon roll, while not only amazing, is only found at this sushi bar, no matter where in the country I have dined on sushi. The southwest salmon roll Is an inside out roll, with salmon and a house cured chili pepper with cucumber and masago on the outside. It is my favorite sushi roll on the planet. As for the sushi, this is the only place in the valley, besides Hiro in North Scottsdale, who serves live scallops. At Hiro, you will pay an arm and a leg, at Kampai, they will be fresher and you will pay fair market price, as set by AJ. The yellowtail and salmon sushi are always cured perfectly, not salty and melt in your mouth. There are both entree specials and sushi specials listed on the white boards above and next to the sushi bar. AJ makes the best salmon and yellowtail collars in the business, while serving better versions of the standard sushi bar appetizer fare, IE. Fried oysters, tempura, etc.. I will end this review here, but rest assured, if you are looking for the best, most authentic sushi dinner in the valley, Kampai is the place."

Great topping, but my favorite was still a or c.  c) Roasted Artichoke - Canned artichokes and red bell peppers which was very refreshing. d) Sausage & Babaganoush - Recommended by our server but was the worst topping.  Tons of sausage, carmelized onions and a layer of babaganoush.  Just was blah and dry. The flavors didn't jump out at you.2) Peach/Pear Bellini- Refreshing but bland.

Two thumbs up for Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet."

But I didn't. After weaving my way through the perplexing plaza that is in front of the patio in front of the restaurant (I saw a sign that said this NOT the entrance, but not one that said this IS the entrance), I finally found the entrance.  The smallish entranceway opens into a grand space that is incredibly lovely with tons of bent steel and bright colors.  I couldn't believe that I was in the same building as the Ranch Market.I was so mesmerized by the beauty of the location, and the display of a gajillion tequilas, and the music of the roving mariachis, that almost any food set before me would have been forgiven.  Almost.  The chips and salsa were okay, but my entree was really disappointing.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas and got a bland enchilada with barely cooked button mushrooms and hardly a shred of spinach! Seriously. I expected to bust into my little rolls to find a plethora of greens, but actually had to dig and search for a mere shriggle.  And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.But, I must confess, my partners pollo looked incredibly tasty and he said it was.  I'll have to take his word for it, because I won't be going back to try again when I could just as easily go to La Tolteca for much better food."

I decided to try it anyways and I'm glad I did.Had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious...and, I have to say, I'm usually pretty picky about burgers. Got a side of sweet potato fries and they were ADDICTIVE. SO GOOD!! Tried the hazelnut-milk chocolate gelato milkshake and it was luscious...very, very tasty! Service was great! My friend and I couldn't decide what we wanted because everything sounded so good. Two servers approached us and kindly offered up some suggestions, even recommending not to spend the money on 2 sides when one side of fries would feed us just fine, without trying to hurry us along. After I ordered a water, I immediately regretted it when I saw rows and rows of natural fountain sodas (like sugar cane soda!).  I didn't try it but will definitely try it next time I go. Then once we finished our meal, the staff didn't try and push us out. They let us stay a bit as we nursed our food comas. Wonderful food. Great staff. Reasonable prices.

ObjectID(5165b71d74c3068b56325d5b),"Italian beef is apparently pretty popular in north Scottsdale - there are three Chicago-style beef places within 2 miles of my work - this one, Luke's, and Taste of Chicago, all three with good Italian beef and other Chicago classics.Al's just opened recently, and I think I'd have to call it my favorite of the three.  The shaved beef is excellent, very flavorful and seasoned perfectly.  I usually add provolone cheese and grilled onions, which go perfectly with the sandwich.  I would definitely recommend getting your sandwich ""dipped"" (the entire sandwich, including bread, gets dipped in the meat juice), to infuse the bread with flavor, otherwise the bread does tend to be slightly dry and hard - not bad, but just not as good as when it's dipped.The fries are very good - freshly cooked and well seasoned, with a home-cooked flavor that beats out the fries at most places.I'm interested in trying some of the other menu items, like the hot dogs, chicken, and burgers, but with Italian beef this good, it's hard to pick something different."

We have raw milk, raw butter, and raw cheese.  My husband of Mexican lineage cooks fabulous New Mexican food when he can procure true chiles from New Mexico.  We buy very fresh fruits and vegetables and meat from pastured animals or wild fish and shellfish. So whenever I go out to a ""Mexican restaurant,"" I don't expect anything as good as I get at home.  Even so, I can't tolerate this stuff.  I ate lunch there, and it's sat in my gut like a rock ever since (5.5 hours now).  I had salsa & chips, and the enchilada trio (I believe I had a cheese one, a chicken one, and a pork one).  A $13 entree for lunch, which wasn't very good - too much for me to pay for something I can't digest very well.  Everything had an odd flavor, like it wasn't quite real food.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324aab),"Ok. So this was my second trip there.  The first time was early on a Tuesday about a year ago, and I remember it being somewhat enjoyable. This time was about 2pm on a Sunday.We wait about 5 mins for a table even though there seems to be plenty of seating.First of all, our waitress must have been stoned.  For her sake I hope she was not naturally that slow.  We had plenty of time to look over our menus since there seemed to be only 2 people working.  After telling her my order, included what I wanted as side, she informs me I have a choice of side and tells me my options. ""Like I said, I'll have the bacon.""No water offered to start off with, had to request some water.  No refills offered for our tea. WTF? Who sees a visibly empty glass on a table and does not offer a refill.  The drink glass was tiny too.  Like juice-cup style.The bacon sucked so bad.  Hard, thin, no flavor (maybe I'm spoiled from Matt's) The portions were small.  The waitress look flustered and although she was cute and trendy looking, I don't go out to eat for trend watching.I had the Sweet Potato pancakes.  She forgot the maple syrup.  Had to wait like 10 mins for her to come around so I could flag her down to bring some.The ""toast"" was cold hard bread.  The crust was so hard it hurt my mouth.The people around us seemed to be having a nice time.  Meanwhile I'm sitting there kinda disgusted actually with how everything is going down.  Maybe we were being discriminated against because we didnt get all spiffied up to go to brunch? I had time to speculate...The only positive thing I can say was that it was a beautiful day outside and they had an impressive tea selection.I got the impression this place put more emphasis on looking ""cool and hip"" on paper than good service and execution.If you want to have long conversations, browse periodicals, being outside on a nice day, and be seen this might be the place for you.If you want prompt service, generous yummy portions, keen waitstaff that recognize you exist and the money you are about to drop there goes towards their paycheck, not the best choice."

However, on my last trip here last week for my father's 69th birthday, I came to a realization.  I realized that this location is geared toward younger, club-going people.  Between the very dim lighting, loudness and type of music playing over the speakers in the main dining area it became clear that this was ""Club Mastro's"".  I know the music is meant to quicken the pace of your meal and get you the heck out of there so the next group of suckers can sit, but I don't want to spend that type of money on a dining experience if I am rushed; directly or indirectly.  Plus I don't like to yell to others at my table and then strain to hear what they are saying.  Keep in mind was 6:00pm on a Saturday.Anyway, I must say again that the food and service were excellent.  Every bit of food that I put in my mouth from the bread, to the salad, to the steak and sides, to the dessert were all top notch.However, at my old age of 31 I think I'm going to stick to the other regular Mastro's locations and dine with the older folk."

After memorizing the menu for weeks, I knew I wanted the Baby Ray. So we go in and I was overjoyed that they had a band playing some sweet grooves. I jammed out a lil while waiting for about 10 minutes. We were seated in a nice lil half booth/table combo and had a huge jar of koolaid and sweet tea delivered to us. Yum! I starting getting the biggest sugar rush halfway through the wait. When my food did arrive, I was presented with two waffles bigger than my face, 3 big pieces of chicken smothered in enough gravy and onions to fill a whole gravy boat. The chicken was spectacular, really good flavor and crisp(when not soaked in gravy, get it on the side?). Gravy was pretty good as well.  The waffles were alright, I can't say I am the biggest waffle fan, but the subtle cinnamon flavor was nice. I think the waffles could have been better in my opinion. I am kicking myself for not trying the grits and collared greens or the red velvet cake. I could not finish my second waffle though, so much food, couldn't even think. The service was probably a B-. The hostess was bubbly and sweet. Our server was busy and a little frazzled maybe. The server gave us the wrong change and seemed to not believe that she had.

It's pretty hidden and the main sign doesn't have the name of the business but just says coffee I believe. The coffee is pretty good. I have come to love the aztec mocha. I also appreciate that the cups are already insulated thus eliminating the need for the crazy cup holder/warmer thing that doesn't really work at all and keeps falling down.The atmosphere is fairly plain.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563259c9),"You know the story of regional burger place In-N-Out. They never freeze their meat, so they're only located near their suppliers, which means that unless you're in California, Arizona, Nevada and even Utah, you can't get In-N-Out.The secret menu I never figured out past asking for my burger ""animal style"", because I pretty much stopped at what I thought was awesome.This particular franchise is located near a heavily trafficked shopping area north of Phoenix proper, and it is staffed by some very friendly and attentive people. It was clean, it was well kept, and the food was as I expected from my many visits to In-N-Out in California- tasty burger, fresh-cut and slightly greasy fries and cold beverages.I like the burgers better at Five Guys, but In-N-Out has a charm and a superior level of service that makes it a pleasant place to dine. Someone actually hired the employees here for their customer service skills and not because they were the cheapest help they could find. That is a reason to patronize this location, right there.Plenty of outdoor seating for the always excellent Valley weather and good for people watching, too."

The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. Experiences with the order could be as follows: Gobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. Lamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. Chicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. Disheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. Finally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities.

ObjectID(5165b71a74c3068b56323f66),"I went to My Mother's for dinner with a large group of family members (16), including 6 kids ranging in age from newborn to 8 years old. While the decor was generically bad ""down-home"" from the 80's, the staff was very nice and seated us in a side room with plenty of space for all of us.The meal started with homemade bread which was warm and soft. This gave me hope that the meal wouldn't be in keeping with the general feel of the place. Alas, my hope was not long lived and I soon felt like an Obama supporter watching McCain win the election.After ordering, I made my way to the salad bar. This seemed quaint, considering that salad bars aren't really popular anymore, unless you're at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes. The salad bar was not entirely scary, but wasn't anything worth going back to. I'm fairly certain everything came out of a can, bag, bottle or box. The freshest thing may have been the red onion, which obviously had been poorly sliced by hand.Moving on to the main course, I had Mother's Meat Loaf dinner. My meat loaf came with rice pilaf and green beans. Once again, food from cans and boxes made an appearance, as my beans were canned and my rice must have come from a box mix. The meatloaf was actually made from non-canned meat, but wasn't all that exciting. It had been cooked with ketchup slathered on top, yet was served with gravy on the side (probably originally made from a powder mix). I ate most of my dinner because I was hungry, not because of the quality.Hoping for a come-from-behind win in a big electoral state, I ordered pie for dessert. They tout their homemade pies, but seem to think that ""homemade"" means making pie from canned ingredients. My cherry pie was not spectacular, as the preprocessed cherry filling was encased in crust which attempted to be light, flaky and buttery, but only managed to be dry and chewy.My Mother's was saved from a one-star rating by two things...the graciousness and patience of the staff, and the low prices. For two dinners and a huge slice of pie split between my wife and I, our total bill including tax and tip was $35.My advice is to keep your hope in homestyle cooking and stay out of My Mother's Restaurant."

I've been craving some New Mexican food lately, and thought this was as good a place to start as any. I had the 2 enchilada dinner plate with the fried egg and beans and rice. The fried egg put these bad boys over the top. Somewhat annoying however that I had to get the whole dinner plate as the ""a la carte"" enchiladas do not come with the egg on top. The enchiladas were awesome. Thick, massa based enchilada with a great spice to them. While many here seem to think the food is especially spicy, I didn't think it was that bad. More the ""runny nose 30 seconds later"" type spicy versus the ""holy hell my tongue is on fire"" spicy. Very, very good. The rice and beans were pretty run of the mill, but when combined with the wet egg and enchilada made for a pretty dang tasty bite. The lemonade, while decent, seemed too sweet and I questioned whether it was home made. Although my server assured me it was, it had that ""Minute Maid"" sort of taste to it. Just too sweet I guess. Extremely delicious table salsas and obviously home made chips. I even started adding the hot salsa to my enchiladas for an extra kick.  Awesome stuff.All in all, a very tasty meal. A really great atmosphere as well.

We had a reservation for 8PM for 4 of us, and at 730PM Andrea asked us to add 2 guests and when Dottsy called Metro they said of course, but please be advised you may have a little wait for the larger table. Which leads me to the only bad point of the evening:We had to wait ONE AND A HALF HOURS for our larger table. We had all expected and accepted a 30 minute wait. After about 40 we went to the bar to get some wine and oysters (otter creeks = yummmm).  After an hour had passed and no one had come to address the situation with our group, I approached the hostess and she was very apologetic and offered to comp our bar tab, which was incredibly nice. When we were finally seated our server was friendly and attentive and had gorgeous blue eyes. Hello!  We were all starving and got right to the point with our orders: I started with the cucumber soup and no amount of yums or mmmmms can fully describe the delight that was set before me. A cold soup, this is made with cucumbers, buttermilk, dill and olive oil, with chunks of lump crabmeat and a dollop of caviar thrown on top, because why the hell not?!  Also, the soup came in a really large bowl and I was full by the time I finished it. I did soldier on to my main course which was the Moules Frites which is what I had the first time I came here and is a truly inspired dish with juicy fresh mussels, and a broth with thyme, garlic and perhaps a little white wine. Then to add insult to injury they serve the huge casoulet with a hearty portion of herbed french fries that were the perfect crispness and didn't leave oil on my hands. Sadly I had to leave some of those friends behind, but only because it was time for dessert! I chose pot de creme which is normally topped with brioche. I requested a brioche-free pot and it was no problem. I was served a tiny ramekin of creamy custard topped with a sort of peanut butter syrup/creme and three slices of caramelized banana. It was really yummy though within 10 minutes my heart was racing from all the sugar. I will point out that this dinner took 2 full hours (we left at 11:30PM) making this the longest I ever spent in a restaurant (3.5 hours are you kidding me?) which is why I ultimately docked one star.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563252d0),"My wife and I went here with my sister and her husband last night.  It was about 6pm and the place was pretty dead.  The place has a pretty decent vibe to it but isn't nearly as eclectic as I had expected for some reason.  I don't know why, but I had visions of this place looking like some Cheech and Chong movie with tie die everywhere.The beer selection is decent and have tons to choose from both in bottles and on draft.  There is something there for everyone and they are glad to let you sample anything on draft.I'm a traditional pizza type of guy so I wasn't sure I was going to like Mellow Mushroom's unconventional pizza offerings.  But I have an open mind and you can't put too much weird sh*t on a pizza, right?While their specialty pizzas are most unique and contain at least what looks to be fresh ingredients, they don't offer much in the way of taste.  I was expecting to be wowed with the great looking crust and flavorful toppings, but I just wasn't.  The crust was too doughy for me (perfectly crispy on the outside however), but the flavor just wasn't there.  They put some type of coating on it and it looks awesome but isn't flavorful at all.  I tried 4 different pizzas and they were all just ok.  They look and sound way better than they taste.  They didn't taste bad, just not awesome.  I mean you are paying ""gourmet"" pizza prices so I wanted gourmet pizza taste.Our waitress was awesome.  She was very personable, friendly and fast.Even if it is a chain I think this place is unique and a great addition to Mill.  However, I'm not entirely sure this place is going to last.  I don't know if college kids (or me for that matter) want to shell out over $30 for a medium pizza and a beer or two.  Pro Tip:  the slices are huge so have them double cut for better sharing."

I have probably had every item on the menu throughout this 12 year relationship and have never had anything I did not like. Here are my top 5: 1. Gyro Feta Pita (loaded with gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and feta)2. Spring Mix Chicken Feta Salad (Enough to feed two people)3. Calamari Feta Salad (Crunchy and tasty) 4. Penelope Pizza (Chicken and Artichoke)5. Fresh Warm Pita Bread (a must have)The restaurant is cozy, casual, clean, and the staff is very friendly and prompt.  I have tried other Greek restaurants in Phx that have either been way to gimmicky or a total bust and none compare to Crazy Jim's.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b563248ea),"Our last couple servers have been warmer and more professional than that earlier clown, but I cant let go of a lingering disdain for this place - even though they're good at what they do. It's just that what they do doesnt really appeal to me anymore. Part of it is the smaller portion/higher prices slam that others have noted. When Houston's opened in a town without much quality going on, little on the menu was over $10. It was a godsend. Then that excellence was understandably incorporated into the pricing structure, but it was still a decent value for a terrific, consistent kitchen, in a culinary burg getting its legs. But now there's half a dozen places within a bike ride of this joint that serve up larger portions of comparable or near comparable quality, far more reasonably.  Oh, I get that you're paying for ambience, but that's the other thing I'm not wild about. This is a place that relatively insecure foodies take companions they're trying to impress, by sitting in a nice room and shelling out some dough. Whether it's your boss or client or prom date, you probably wont go too wrong here. The food will be good to excellent,  there will be at least a veneer of fine service. People will say it was lovely at the end of the meal, and in the event that they dont, it wont be your fault. It's also the sort of place where everyone looks you over. The maitre d, the other customers. Hillstone attracts that sort of moneyed voyeur, compared to dimly lit, almost semi private Houston's. Now there's a see and be seen element in the dining area that used to be confined to the bar.  It's just me. I get this is a formula for success.  See Scottsdale.  But for me, there are more reasonable nearby places providing quality grub and atmosphere, whether it's Postinos, The Parlor, Sierra Bonita or Hana, or even more spartan spaces like Seekong By Night.  They're all good and fun in their own way. Hillstone is just good. There's no fun in it for me. As a stodgy Phoenician, I feel inexorably ripped off and just dont wanna be around many of these people."

I stopped by one recent Sunday after church and ate myself into a happy food coma. We decided to share the cinnamon stuffed french toast and silver dollar blueberry baked pancakes because we were told both were a must-try menu items! For some reason I thought silver dollar pancakes meant they were small, but I soon learned that nothing at Wy-Knot Cafe is small! I don't even know how to begin to describe the cinnamon stuffed french toast. Heaven in your mouth? Yes. Dessert for breakfast? Yes. Worth every single calorie and then some? A million times yes! The combination of the fluffy cinnamon french toast and the cream cheese stuffing is divine. The dish is huge and because each bite is so amazing, it's tempting to find it in your to gorge yourself and finish! I definitely ate more of the cinnamon stuffed french toast than the silver dollar pancakes, but those were also very good! However, the french toast trumped any other dish in my mind. The silver dollar blueberry pancakes were huge! The dish comes with three very large baked pancakes and so the meal was very much of a carbo-load...in a very good way! After all, if you are going to consume the calories, it might as well be worth it and this food was very much worth it. We got lucky because when we went, it wasn't very crowded. Therefore our food didn't take too long. However, I did learn that they have a small kitchen, so beware that if it's busy in the cafe, the food will take a little longer. But stick around because trust me, it's worth the wait!!!"

When we were here in June she went twice in the same week and i have already there again since we moved here. She loves the the Burrito enchilada style with green sauce and rice and beans. I promise you when you get this food they put it in a container that keeps it hot for at least 3 hours...and i mean hot people. Now there are only about 5 items on the menu...and i will post those pics as well...and you will see that this Mexican food is expensive.Despite all of that though there is always a crowd at this neighborhood spot...and you will see people from all walks of life there for lunch every single day. Now noticed i said lunch because they only stay open to about 4pm and then they are ghost folks...LOL.

ObjectID(5165b71c74c3068b56324aad),"This is a new destination in old town. The atmosphere is hip and ultra-modern, yet remains relaxed and comfortable. We tried this on a Saturday night around 9pm and were lucky to get one of the last booths available. Once seated our waitress was a real trooper - she kept all 5 of us in food and drinks for about two hours (and the place was slammed). They mostly offer small plates and a few select entrees. Food is above average quality, and affordable. Here's the rub: This is really more of a restaurant than a bar, more about eating/drinking with a group of friends than a date night or party scene. The good news is that when you finish dinner there are dozens of nightlife options in walking distance. Personally I think they should turn the upstairs patio into more of a bar. *I hear happy hour here is awesome."

Seriously, Ive been to a Cheesecake Factory for birthday parties... or in malls. But I had to rate this place, bc the waiter was off the charts one of the best I have ever, yep! ever had... I told him I didnt have much of an appetite, as I mulled the book of a menu over and over and kept sending him away and my 'wanting only dessert friend' now wanted some orange chicken too... and bread...and a side salad.. geesh.. how can a 90lb girl want so much food? ... I ended up with a chicken sandwiche and soup... none of which was earth shattering... but I loved the waiter... we had fun with the fact that the seemingly 'we never get out much' peeps next to us didnt know how to act in a restaurant...and he brought us a piece of decadent red velvet cheese cake and even wrote in cursive a cute little note for me and my friend.. and I will leave it at that:-) Score for the factory.. compliments of the waiter...

Yes, it's a chain, but I definitely give props to a restaurant chain that makes food as delicious as Brio.  There are no negatives or neutrals about this place.+ Wonderful service.  Our waitress was so nice.  She helped me make a decision on my meal and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Also, the other employees were happy and spunky.+ You can add or modify your meal as needed.  A lot of big restaurants (especially more expensive ones) don't allow you do personalize your meal.+ FOOD.  Oh my goodness.  If you want a meal that is flavorful, cooked right, and unique, you have to try this place.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.+ Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.+ Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.  Even if you don't eat a meal here, you MUST try their desserts!!

I never really got into it, so I don't have a seasoned boba palate, but I do know a good boba cafe when I see one and Eba is the real deal.The little details here struck me as legit.  * The boba flavors and extras are extensive - probably about 50 or so different flavors and way to order. I opted for the vanilla green tea complete with little tapioca balls at the bottom, which satiated my (at the time) liquid diet.* Hot food lunch offerings. When I met Gabi and other Yelpers I noticed I could have even had a full-on rice chicken curry lunch.  *  But the icing on the cake was the karaoke set in the corner.  Hellz YES, how authentically Asian -- Karaoke when you're sober!!  Oh the horror, good thing no one spiked my boba otherwise I would have been strutting on the table singing ""Humpty Dance"" by Digital Underground much to my and your dismay.I'm liking you Eba.

I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. I ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. Yesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. I had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad. I am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week.
